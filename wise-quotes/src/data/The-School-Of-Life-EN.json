      "title": "HOW TO BE A GREAT LOVER",
      "text": "The goal of becoming an ideal lover has a tendency to bring up certain stock images: a slender physique, clear eyes, taut skin, a successful business, a confident manner.\n\nThese have their advantages no doubt, but the true virtues of love might lie in a slightly different, slightly less heralded corner. An ideal lover might be endowed with some of the following:\n\nImperfection\nHowever pleasing accomplishments might be, what truly nurtures love is someone’s relationship to their flaws: a basic and calm recognition that they may - somewhat surprisingly - have a great many of them. They haven’t understood everything. They aren’t unfailingly decent. They lose focus. They’re prone to jealousy. They mess up all the time. No one who has properly explored and understood themselves can be convinced of their marvellousness for long. An ideal lover doesn’t need persuading of their fragilities; they want our help to be able to bear and overcome them. They aren’t defensive in the face of criticism. They say sorry almost before we have spoken. Such is their degree of self-awareness, they feel - at a base level - really very grateful that anyone would put up with them. Which can make them very appealing indeed to be around.\n\nExplanations\nWe don’t need flawless people. We need people who have a good sense of how broken they are and can warn us about the problems before they’ve done too much damage, in a way that can make us feel hopeful (about change) and unfrightened (about the status quo).\n The ideal lover knows the back story to their anger and anxiety, self-pity and indolence. We don’t have to stumble on their issues and suffer from being told we’re crazy or mean for mentioning, or attempting to make sense of, them. They hand us - early on, with grace - a fairly dense folder of their follies.\n\nHumour\nThey aren’t - of course - funny for laugher’s sake. The best lovers are - in essence - laughing at themselves. They are inviting laughter about how ridiculous they are, how vain they can be, how conceited they feel. They laugh because they again said the wrong thing and because they try so hard but keep annoying us anyway. They laugh so that we don’t have to scream or cry.\n\nBenevolence\nThe best lovers have a benevolent interpretation of motives. They don’t immediately believe that we are doing it on purpose, to punish them or bring them down. They know that, however maddening we are, we probably haven’t set out on a single minded mission to destroy what remains of their lives. They keep in mind the small originally sincere and innocent child beneath the very complicated and sometimes no longer so charming adult. They are quick to imagine that we might, deep down, still be dealing with a hurt from a careless parent or a humiliation at work - or might simply be very tired and in need of a hug.\n\nIntelligence\nThey don’t need to know string theory or quantum mechanics. They need a grasp of the key tenets of emotional intelligence: how anger can mask hurt, how impatience may arise from anxiety, how those who are mean are passing on a meanness done to them, how there is almost always a childhood cause behind an adult snarl, how people mistake figures in their present for ghosts in their pasts, how irony masks pain… They know that the emotional mind is a very peculiar and counter-intuitive organ crying out for interpretation and curiosity.\n\nOddity\nThey have room for our strangeness. They are not overly attached to their or our normality. They know - from spending sufficient time in their own mind - that sex is very odd for everyone, that we’re all more envious, anxious, petty, glorious and intelligent than we’re meant to be. \n\nWe love them for who they are; we love them even more for how we can feel about ourselves in their company.\n\n\n"

      "title": "THREE REASONS WHY WE BADLY NEED LOVE",
      "text": "It can feel like an unfair topic. Either we lack love, at which point we hardly need to hear further reminders of what we are missing. Or we have love, and its advantages are surely evident.\n\nBut both when we search for love and when we have secured it, we can benefit from a more focused understanding of its role and purpose: the native deficiencies it can help us to correct, the ways in which it can enhance us, why its disappearance can crush us. \n\nONE: Self-Knowledge\nIt is strangely very hard to understand ourselves when we are merely by ourselves. Self-knowledge is - necessarily - a two-person business. We need another’s mirroring function to know the shape of our own characters. It’s only when they start to laugh that we understand that we said something funny. Or because they got irritated that we sense we crossed a boundary. Or because they were moved by our story that we register that we might have suffered a wound. The amount we feel we have to say to another person is determined by how much we unconsciously sense they are able to grasp. One person can ask us what we did for the weekend and our minds will go blank; another can ask the same question and unleash a stream of memories and thoughts. \n\nTWO: Self-Acceptance\nIt can be hard - left to our own devices - to put up with being, always, us. We know so much about what is awful, compromised and embarrassing in our natures. We could cut together a film that, if it were ever released, would damn us forever. We have direct acquaintance with some ghastly pieces of information that can make us want to scream at their memory. We can’t forget what happened in childhood, or the messier moments of adolescence or the dreadful mistakes we’ve made over the decades, especially around love and work. Why me, and why this again, we may wonder in front of the mirror at the start of another day, on seeing our heavy, sad, cowardly eyes looking back at us. \n\nThat’s, in part, why we need love so much. Someone to help staunch the torrent of self-doubt and lend us another perspective on our miserable natures. They don’t need to think we are angels, in fact, such idealisation would be merely another hurtful misunderstanding and a contributor to fresh loneliness. We don’t want them to think us amazing, we need them to judge us as fools but - crucially - as loveable fools; we want them to bring a charitable eye to bear on our silliness. We long that they spot a basic decency beneath the gruff exterior; that they register the efforts we make behind the scenes, that they remember the child in us, that they know that we do - for the most part, despite some awful lapses - fundamentally mean rather well. \n \nTHREE: A CURE FOR PARANOIA\n\nAlone in the night, the fears build up without mercy: why wouldn’t they be trying to get us fired? Couldn’t the business plausibly go under? What if someone broke into the server? Why wouldn’t everyone hate us? Why isn’t catastrophe coming for us today? Fear runs unchecked through an isolated mind.\n\nBut with another body next to us, a little of the raw terror abates. Gently, they push back against our fateful analyses. Are you sure they said they despise you? Why would they try to ruin your life? I don’t think it’s likely that they’d remember that conversation, after three decades…\n\nMaybe there is - after all - another way of looking at the crisis. Perhaps we aren’t on the verge of wholesale disintegration. The world might still have some mercy and patience in it. \n\nThe lover may not, in the course of this life-saving work, be saying anything dramatically new.  We might have said the same thing to ourselves, but with no effect whatsoever. What matters is that they - another mind - are saying it, that their reasoned intelligence has pointed them to another less awful conclusion. That they are ‘not us’ and they think it’s going to be OK. That they don’t see a straight line between where we’re at and a prison or a morgue. \n\nLike the very scared mollusc we are, we ask them to say it again: are you sure it might be OK? Do you really think I didn’t do anything bad? And, with a weary tenderness (it might be 3.45 a.m. and this might have started an hour ago), they might say: yes, I’m sure. I’m really sure. You don’t have anything to worry about. Now turn over and go to sleep, you silly goose. \n\nAnd with such a divine command, the raging waters of panic recede and the fires of torment dampen. We’re going to be able to sleep a little more now. The day ahead will be saved. We hold their hand very tightly indeed. That’s why we need love.\n\n"

      "title": "THE TERROR OF LOVE",
      "text": "It could sound like an odd word to associate with love. Surely love, especially in its early stages, is mostly about sweetness, supportiveness, delight and gratitude. What are we doing, introducing a word with Gothic associations into a place of tenderness and reassurance?\n\nBut to anyone with experience, there’s nothing too misplaced about such language. The fastest way to mental illness, degradation and confusion is through the innocent gates of love. The best way to ruin one’s life is to marry the wrong person (there isn’t a ‘right’ one). This is where we should come to lose our confidence, to dissolve our trust in others, to question our sense of reality, to fall very ill.\n\nOf course love has its sweetness, but that is precisely why it brings such trouble. It asks us to shed our usual defences, it gets otherwise fierce and practical people to put away their scepticism. Then it starts to pull its surprises.\n\nTo love is to lose control. What if they take a job elsewhere? What if they start to remember their ex (a hateful but mesmerising sort)? They have a phone. It wouldn’t take much for them to suddenly realise they needed greater freedom or, heaven forbid, more ‘fun.’\n\nThere isn’t - and shouldn’t be - anything overly reassuring to say here. We should stay at home if safety continues to be our central priority. The best one might do is sympathise (a lot) with the fears. If we’re doing this right, it should be terrifying; we should be sleeping a bit less. A tile could kill them. They might trip on a platform edge. Someone is going to die first; grief is baked in from the start. And worse than death (almost) are those changes of mind softly expressed (‘I love you so much, it’s just that recently…’). We can’t chain them - but let’s admit how much even a sane mind might not think that was such a bad idea, all told.\n\nThis is what a frank letter to the sweetheart might sound like in the early days: Thank you so much for entering my life. I’m gaining so much pleasure from you being here; it feels very alarming. You’re amazing; a part of me is looking for reasons to run away… (Don’t send it).\n\nThe best way to get through the worry is to embrace a dark perspective: I could lose them, and it could be OK. Note the limp term, not that it could be fine, brilliant or a chance to learn but just about OK - by which we really mean that we would be abject for at least half the duration of the relationship, so if it was five years we’d be crying for two and half and if it lasted ten and so on… That's a lot of time we're mortgaging.\n\nIt might be kindest to simply say: people rarely die from heartbreak. And quote Seneca: What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.\n\nWe won’t be starting to pay love its proper dues so long as we deny the risk - but we’ll also be unnecessarily gloomy if we obsess that it might kill us. It really, really won’t. Or at least doesn't very often.\n\n"

      "title": "THE FIRST REALLY ROMANTIC MOMENT IN LOVE",
      "text": "We might be overcome by choice when trying to identify the first really Romantic moment in a relationship: maybe the time when they bought a small bunch of primroses to dinner, or when we remembered their favourite jam (apricot) or when we kissed them by the lake or they told us we had the loveliest hands…\n\nBut more seasoned observers might chose to locate the most truly Romantic moment elsewhere: in the first moment of discord that two people were brave enough to address slowly and steadily. In the time they had a small argument about one of their laughs. Or there was a serious discussion about the colour of a jumper someone had chosen. Or there was a tense moment after a much delayed appointment.\n\nLet’s imagine that, when an issue came up, the mildly offended person didn’t go silent. They didn’t say to themselves: I’m not allowed to complain, these are the early days of love, who am I to raise a problem with someone who has been so nice to me? What is wrong with a bright violet jumper anyway? Or: why shouldn’t they be twenty minutes late again? \n\nThey didn’t hide the hurt from themselves or their new partner in order to try to focus on other, ‘better things.’ They had the courage to interrupt the flow of optimism, in the name of clearing channels of communication and of feeling. They understood that the great enemy of love isn’t complaining but a failure to do so early enough, they knew that the fastest way to kill intimacy is to stop talking about awkward things - and that behind many a case of so-called ‘tiredness’ at the idea of having sex is a difficult conversation that hasn’t been had. \n\nThey held their nerve enough to be good ‘teachers’ in love, taking their ‘student’ through a complicated topic with lightheartedness, at an appropriate moment, maybe with levity and self-deprecation, to ensure that it stood the very best chance of being heard.\n\nAt the same time, the ‘student’ didn’t give way to paranoia. Even if they had several painful relationships behind them, they allowed themselves to believe in the benevolence and fundamental goodness of the new person before them. They didn’t turn on them and say with aggression (and underlying fear): I can’t believe you’re making such a fuss. Why can’t you be more accepting? I love my jumper, why can’t you? Or: No one has complained about my laugh before. They could trust that there might be a problem; they didn’t think that they themselves were one. \n\nRomance requires that the listener trust that they are not about to be randomly and meanly attacked, that their new partner isn’t attempting to wound them for the sake of it, that they are simply trying to explain a tricky or intense bit of their world view, in the name of deepening connection and safety: that a ‘complaint’ is in essence a privilege. As a real Romantic, they therefore listen very carefully and let out small signs they are doing so: ‘Go on…’ ‘How interesting…’ ‘Do say more…’ They thank the partner for their honesty, they signal they welcome frank dialogue, they make sure the other knows that there is always time for problems calmly divulged.\n\nThe real enemy of love is never upset, it’s resentment that hasn’t been shared in time or that hasn’t been met with sufficient bravery and curiosity. We shouldn’t panic if - in the early days of love - we find ourselves in conversations that feel rather serious about things that seem ‘heavier’ than they should be. We mustn’t worry about sounding complicated, we should be very afraid of pretending that we are any easier than we are.\n\n"

      "title": "THE BURDEN OF CHILDHOOD",
      "text": "It is one of the most consistently irritating claims of modern psychology: that the early years, from zero to ten, determine pretty much everything about a person’s emotional functioning (how they love, who they trust, how they esteem themselves, the way they communicate…) and are the single greatest factor in explaining the difference between one human and another.\n\nTo be asked to imagine, at the age of thirty, fifty-five or ninety-two that we are still, despite our increasing knowledge, our professional accomplishments and the sheer time that has elapsed, like marionettes, being pulled by factors which set in when we were barely the size of a chair violates all our reasonable wishes for autonomy and dignity - and for the chance for a fresh start.\n\nPart of what makes the claim so implausible is that it is extremely hard to ‘see’, remember or imagine that the circumstances of our childhood could have had such an impact. We don’t remember ever being explicitly taught about self-esteem or communication styles. There wasn’t any particular moment when we recall coming to conclusions about trust. We have no memory of learning what we apparently now know in such detail - and so indelibly - about attachment. We just seem to have been busy building sandcastles and (according to certain pictures in the old album) doing a lot of handstands.\n\nBut if we are to keep faith with the overall psychological thesis, it may be helpful to make an analogy with language. It’s also in childhood, chiefly between the years of zero and five, that we learnt an enormous amount about language, that we acquired a native tongue. Without us noticing, without us going to any school to do so, as we went about our daily business (imitating animals in the garden, drawing buttercups in the kitchen), we acquired a whole vocabulary and an advanced understanding of grammar. We picked up information about verb endings, tenses, sentence structures and hundreds of declensions, nouns, adjectives and adverbs - all the while having little clue that any of this was in train. \n\nFurthermore, what we learnt was heavily influenced by the people most immediately around us. It was the precise accents of one or two people in the vicinity who powerfully moulded our manner of expression, not just for the short term - but for our entire lives.\n\nAt exactly the same time, alongside grammatical language, we were acquiring another sort of language, an emotional language about love, about men, about women, about anger, joy, vulnerability, sorrow and tenderness. Without us noticing, we picked up ‘rules’ about what happens when you give yourself to someone, what value we might have in another’s eyes, what is required of us to build up affection or maintain loyalty. We learnt principles no less complicated than those in grammatical language about how we should reveal our frustration to someone or how likely we might be to be forgiven for a wrongdoing.\n\nAnd as with grammatical language, these rules came not from our entire society, not from the influence of millions, but from the ‘teachings’ of just a few people most immediately around us. They would be our unconscious teachers and role models.\n\nThere is another point of similarity. Emotional language is very hard indeed to shift. As anyone who has ever tried, for example, in middle age to pick up a new dialect, who has bravely attempted to learn Finnish or Korean, Portuguese or Inuit at 45 or 52 will know, change doesn’t come easily. We shed our ‘voice’ of origin with great difficulty.\n\nThis might help us to be patient with our psyches. It is easy to get fed up with how stubbornly we seem to stick to old ways of feeling and acting. We may visit a psychotherapist and complain that, despite showing up obediently every week for seven months, we still lose our temper too often, we’re still inclined to sabotage ourselves in public, we haven’t yet learnt how to express ourselves affectionately with people we love. \n\nOur frustration is understandable, but not - for that matter - any more reasonable than would be the sighs of someone who had spent the equivalent time trying to master Icelandic and was still stumbling with ‘Hvar er lestarstöðin, takk?’ (where is the train station please?’) and ‘Ég elska þig’ (I love you). Emotional language can’t be shifted overnight any more than can its grammatical equivalent. We’ll sound foreign for a long while.\n\nWe should go easy on ourselves. We may never entirely shed the ‘accent’ of our birthplace. But we can do a lot nevertheless. We can understand the distinctive way in which we speak. We can take care - where necessary - to warn others of our ‘dialect’. We can be aware that there may sometimes be a discordance between our words and our intentions. And then, more hopefully, we can at other times surprise and delight acquaintances by clearing our throat and saying, with surprising fluency and a lot of charm, in an accent that really isn’t bad at all: 'მე მინდა რომ თქვენ იცოდეთ რომ მე ვფიქრობ თქვენზე' (I want you to know that I think about you - Georgian) or 'Ndinokuthanda, kodwa ndiyoyika' (I love you, but I'm afraid - Xhosa).\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "We are used to hearing quite a lot - from those on the dating scene - about just how many awful people there are at large in the field of love. There was one who spoke only about themselves; another who refused to pay for anything; a third who talked incessantly of marriage from the first date then vanished to another continent; a fourth who wanted to dress up in a clown’s costume during sex. And so on and so forth.\n\nWe can have a lot of sympathy for the casualties - and enthusiasm for exploring the annals of clinical psychology and psychoanalysis to interpret the ways of these perpetrators. We wonder what childhood dynamics might have led to their many oddities; we skilfully size up the scale of their possible madness. We turn failed relationships into case studies.\n\nBut at some point, as those who endured the weirdness, we may need to step back and ask ourselves a blunter and more confronting question: why were we there? \n\nWhy, if they didn’t ever listen, if they couldn’t speak up, if they were never in the mood for sex, if they were egoistic or grandiose, maniacal or perpetually sarcastic, why were we with them? Why did it go on for months, even years or decades? Why, in a planet of many billions of people, did we stick so assiduously to an endemically flawed option?\n\nIt isn’t good enough simply to call them mad. They may well have been. But what about the madness - if we can put it indelicately - in showing such loyalty to the mad? \n\nMight we not also be relevant material for case studies of sorts, case studies about people who prefer suffering to fulfilment; people who harbour their own apprehensions around sex or cosiness but hide them behind more obviously disturbed or withholding partners; people who head for frustrating dynamics to ward off archaic fears of losing control to happiness; people who may routinely have turned down kinder, more present candidates, insisting that there were no other options at large? Why did we stay endlessly around someone who didn’t pay for anything, who couldn’t be gentle, who didn’t want to touch us? What part of us was intrigued, and perhaps (as it were) almost charmed, by dissatisfaction and coldness? What gap did insufficiency fill in our own not entirely straightforward hearts?\n\nWe can rail all we like about the wrong people, we can nurse our sadness with immense tenderness, but when we are done, when we have poured over their follies for months, we may need to spare a few enquiries for ourselves: we may need to ask - with curiosity and compassion - what might possibly have gone wrong with us for maintaining such stubborn faith in the wrong people, how might we be a touch mad for being so interested in the 'mad'?\n\n"

      "title": "WHY PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE IN WAR ZONES",
      "text": "There is an unusual-sounding commonly observed behaviour to be found in wars. Against a background of destruction and chaos, there is a notable increase in the tempo and intensity of love. In an atmosphere of danger, love grows oddly more possible. This lets us know something crucial not just about wars, but about the nature of love: that it is, even during relatively good times, very frightening indeed.\n\nThe risks can feel huge. The other will change their mind. We will trust and they will leave. They will tell us something adorable and not quite mean it. We will dismantle our defences and find they don’t do the same. They will judge us for our stories or our physique. We will get used to their warmth and then be returned to solitude. \n\nNo wonder if we are tempted to stay very guarded indeed. No wonder if - in some moods, despite our underlying wishes - we go nowhere near love. We say instead that there is no one around, we find fault with every candidate we meet, we throw ourselves into our work, we keep delaying appointments. Anything other than to face (again) the risks of ruptured trust and abandonment.\n\nIt isn’t that we don’t want love; we’re just pre-emptively very exhausted by, and terrified of, loss.\n\nBut all dangers are relative. Faced with the ultimate disaster, when it seems unclear whether anything will survive even the coming days, as news of the invaders reaches the city, the dangers of love are placed in a new context. Judged against an artillery barrage, the thrum of drones or a night sky illuminated by phosphorous flares, the terrors of love are recalibrated.\n\nIf there’s a chance this might be the last weekend, that the city may fall this month, that the water may run out in hours, what were once untenable perils are redrawn. Petrified, we do what we had always wanted to do, had we not been so scared.\n\nWe call them up and tell them we adore them. We make an appointment for the station near the shelter at midday. We stand down our pride and explain without reservation that we have seldom felt this way, that we adore their way of saying certain words and of holding us in their arms. \n\nFor a time, as the two sides have it out beyond the city gates, we embrace and plan in appropriate depth the future we may never have. \n\nThen an armistice is signed, peace returns. Caution finds its way back. We put off calling them. We fail to speak our emotions. We rethink the marriage plans.\n\nThe moral: that we should be living - in key ways - as if there were a war. That we might learn something important about how to manage our exposure to danger from the most dangerous of all situations. \n\nThe irony is that the ‘peace’ we believe in is an illusion. We are far closer to the constituents of war than we think. The political realm may (for now) be safe enough. But we are never beyond the possibility of sudden annihilation. Our appendix or colon can destroy us as effectively as any guided missile - and as unexpectedly. Death may come tonight. \n\nWe are notoriously bad at calibrating hazards. We spend a lifetime carefully attempting not to make mistakes - and make even greater mistakes as a result. We try not to lose and thereby lose everything.\n\nWe should, in certain key ways, live as if there were a war. That is, gratefully, avidly, with a greater acceptance of our exposure to decimation, with a knowledge that nothing is assured, with a commitment to make the most of our opportunities if we make it through the night. Let’s - therefore - call them up. Let’s explain what we actually feel; let’s make a fool of ourselves. There are many greater threats once we assess our circumstances properly. We should, to guide our next moves, raise a strange sounding question: if there were a war right now, what would we do? And do it anyway."

      "text": "Those of us who are most interested in love, who associate it with the summit of satisfaction, may be haunted by an ideal: that we can - eventually - get it right.\n\nOne day, if we read enough, if we have sufficient therapy, if we are extremely thoughtful in our choices, if we communicate maturely and honestly, if we lay aside time every day to explore and process resentments, if we take care to understand the minutiae of our emotional functioning, if we put in the time, we will one day find ourselves in a supremely stable and flourishing relationship, one that is gracious, calm, cosy and tender, one where there’s a sense of complicity and mutual sympathy for past sufferings, one that lasts not just for a while, but until the end. Here, finally, there will be sweetness, there will be trust, there will be safety. We will have reached the harbour.\n\nAn old Jewish saying comes to mind: Man thinks, god laughs. One might add: Man plans, god laughs. Or: Man imagines he might be able to work it out, god laughs. Or: Man thinks he could conceivably one day reach the harbour, and god giggles.\n\nWe should take care. We don’t need to punish ourselves twice. Once with an ideal. Twice with a sense of sorrow and persecution if we fail to reach it.\n\nNaturally, we must do our very best. We can scan assiduously for mental imbalances at the dating stage. We should learn about attachment theory. We can ask probing questions. We can step away from the most obvious problems: someone who withholds, who is violent, who can’t control themselves. We can talk with a therapist about whether we may be drawn to rejecting goodness. We can insist on polite treatment, we can apologise and complain with diplomacy. We can read John Bowlby and Donald Winnicott, Melanie Klein and Janina Fischer. We can schedule regular check-ins. We can hold our destination firmly in mind: a secure base, laughter and forgiveness, a person who can welcome our reality and we theirs.\n\nNone of it is strange, all of it belongs to the noblest, most legitimate aspirations. \n\nBut it is also profoundly and thoroughly impossible. It isn’t a viable philosophy. It’s a fantasy dressed up in the language of therapeutic enlightenment. We mustn’t - to be kind to ourselves - ever be searching for eternal satisfaction. We can’t believe in total safety. We must never assume that we can reach any sort of a conclusive destination.\n\nWe can think we know everything about someone. But there may be another family, a different sexuality, a new sense of alienation or a fresh desire for freedom. Or else disaster comes from without. They lose the power of speech. The mind or the pancreas give way. Then, once more, homelessness, grief, isolation, loss. Back out on the heath, bewildered and forlorn. \n\nLet us - therefore - outline and adopt a stiffer counsel, a more workable philosophy that can honour our longings and yet make proper room for disaster. \n\n1. Never believe in safety. So long as one is alive, one is exposed. Another person can never be adequately directed or contained. There is too much that is unpredictable and mysterious in everyone. We can never fully know who is in front of us. They can assure us of loyalty every new day - and still change their minds. We must keep our muscles trained. We can’t allow ourselves to fall into a deep sleep. We have to imagine that they might not be telling us the whole truth. To love is to surrender to unpredictability. The greatest sense of safety is born from knowing there is no ultimate safety. There could always be a need to leave home. We must keep a small bag packed at all times.\n\n2. We can survive. We have done it before and will be able to do so again. At any age; after any amount of cosiness. We may use baby language with them and yet we aren’t, thank goodness, small helpless children. We could dismantle the shared references. We could forget the nicknames. We could erase the memories, delete the photos and throw away the teddies. We might need to start again in our seventies or eighties. Nothing has been assured. Expect everything, reckon on everything. We are loving humans, not statues. We might need to return to one room. We might be crying every morning. We would survive.\n\n3. We should not let our hopes rest on a single person. The best defence against disappointment is to have a lot going on - and some very good friends too. This isn’t un-Romantic. It’s truly Romantic, defined as conducive to the support and sustenance of love.\n\n4. Heave close to pessimism. Darkness isn’t despair, it can be the most mature kind of protection. It’s compatible with a lot of laughter. We can crack jokes on the way to the gallows. We didn’t ask to be built this way, to be so exposed to accident and changes of mind, to be part of such a wayward and peculiar species, to have such longings for perfection and to be working with so much unsteadiness and doubt.\n\n5. Because of it all, we must properly, with open arms, appreciate when things are going well. When there is a week without an argument, when someone shows up with cheerfulness and open-heartedness, when there’s a very enjoyable holiday or Saturday afternoon. We begin to appreciate mere moments when we amply realise that eternity is never guaranteed. There was a pleasant lunch, today went well, it’s been nice this week. These are the increments that the experienced delight in. Never again take stability for granted. Nothing is forever, we’re made largely of water. A penny dropped from one storey can kill us. Remember Sophocles: call no human, and certainly no lover, happy till they die. \n\n"

      "text": "We will not have understood very much about how love really works so long as we insist, with forgivable reasonableness and hope, that what we principally seek from relationships is to be happy.\n\nTo secure a properly rounded sense of what is really at play in love, we need to conceive of our minds as split into two - a conscious and an unconscious part - and limit our more optimistic and coherent expectations to the former.\n\nConsciously, we may well speak of a wish to identify someone we desire and to build a sweet and supportive home with them. Unconsciously, the picture is distinctly more complicated.\n\nThough consciousness is where we look out at the world from, it is by far the smaller of the two parts of the mind. We might think of it as a meagre flashlight vainly illuminating a patch of ground here or there in a vast pitch-dark labyrinth. As much as 95% percent of what goes on in our minds happens far outside our conscious purview. ‘We’ are constantly doing things that ‘we’ aren’t in any way able to account for or speak about, for example, turning lunch’s veal cutlet into amino acids, glucose and adenosine triphosphate, manipulating the pluperfect and the subjunctive in a complaint about a late train, repairing strands of DNA in our sleep, coordinating the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles as we use a ladder to change a lightbulb and activating the fusiform gyrus in the temporal and occipital lobes to recognise a friend coming towards us down a corridor. \n\nIn all these cases, we both know and don’t know. Something in our brains is following a set of principles but we haven’t been gifted a power to speak about or grasp these in any direct way. There is - for much of the time - a ghost, or at least a very powerful agent we can’t dialogue with - inside our own minds.\n\nWhen it comes to love, the unconscious is especially active - and determinedly cryptic. It guides us on our first dates, it configures our minds as we prepare for bed, it inspires us to speak - or not - on weekend breaks. And all the while, we have little clue that the unconscious even exists, let alone that it is busy moulding the course of love. \n\nNevertheless we have, collectively, over the years, learnt to retrospectively identify a few of its signature moves and methods of interpretation. To summarise a selection of these:\n\n- the unconscious doesn’t appear able or inclined to distinguish between periods of time; it exists in a semi-permanent present dating back to early childhood. It doesn’t differentiate between the world as it was when we were a toddler and as it might be for us today. A three year old’s mute rage at an unavailable parent might, through the operations of the unconscious, be blithely reenacted in the life of a forty-year old attempting to make a new relationship work.\n\n- the unconscious isn’t overly interested in close distinctions between people. It works on the basis of archetypes that form early in its existence and are then applied liberally when making sense of later arrivals. For its purposes, a wife may silently read simply as ‘mother’, a boyfriend as ‘brother’; and every angry man, with no less mystery than the consolidation of memories in the hippocampus during REM sleep, as ‘daddy.’\n\n- the unconscious settles, early in its existence, on a level of happiness which it associates with stability. Later departures, even in a positive direction, create a paradoxical sense of alarm and initiate invisible processes of homeostatic correction. The calm and supportiveness gifted to us by a new partner may come across as awkward, even extremely threatening, to the unconscious mind, which might then guide us to subtly detonate a fledgling relationship in order to return us to a more habitual state of alienation and sadness. The unconscious likes, and prioritises, what it knows and is used to - even when this happens to be a state of misery, resignation, masochism and despair.\n\n- the unconscious is interested in helping us to refind, in the present, characters who remind it of challenging parental figures from childhood, perhaps in order to make breakthroughs that were not originally available to it. It will, with uncanny precision, help us to pick out (from among hundreds of candidates) just the sort of person who will in time wind up drinking as avidly as our father or being as sarcastic and belittling as our mother. It wants us, in the deep sense, to keep returning home. \n\n- the unconscious is highly adept at devising strategies that enable a child to survive in a hostile early family environment. It will help a five year old to work out that it should be very quiet and meek so as to survive the temper of a parent. It will tell a seven year old that it should be antisocial in order to be noticed by distracted caregivers. It will teach a nine year old never to share anything about its feelings to a family that doesn't care. What it isn’t good at doing is realising that times change - and the wisdom of certain strategies along with it. It forgets that emotional withdrawal, passive underconfidence or provocative rebelliousness may not be ideal in a marriage; it can invisibly spoil our chances of ever sustaining a relationship.\n\n- the unconscious is a repository of a rage that periodically needs to discharged, but without too much regard for who or what might originally have caused it. The rage, typically owed to certain people in the past who made it impossible to express because they were too frightening, distracted or fragile, may sit unattended for many decades until opportunities for safe expression arise. For the unconscious, it really doesn’t matter so much whether one is taking revenge on a parent who betrayed and tormented one as a child or a partner who has - in fact - been nothing but kind and supportive since the honeymoon started three days ago. What counts is to drain the tank.\n\nIn other words, it is on account of a very curious, very powerful unconscious that we are able to systematically ruin our chances of contentment in love: that we turn against lovers who are kind, blow up relationships that are viable, hunt out partners who will hurt us, fall into depression on the eve of marriages or grow unable to have sex with spouses we love.\n\nIt may sound dispiriting but hopelessness isn't called for either. The unconscious, though immensely powerful, is not unstoppable. Our conscious minds, even if they comprise only five percent of our mental capacities, have agency. We have a genuine capacity to work out some of what we are most tempted to do - and to then act otherwise.\n\n\nWe can, in the physical arena, feel a very strong impulse to sneeze - and resist it. We can be certain that a balcony is about to give way - and step onto it anyway. Our inner alarm may do its best to convince us a plane is about to crash - and we can ignore it. \n\nSimilarly, in love, we can feel how much a part of us would like to punish a new partner for being kind to us - and nevertheless refuse to undermine them. We can note the pull of mysterious, sadistic lovers who seek to injure and torment us - and tell them we’re busy at the moment. We can know how much happiness scares us - and stay put. We can notice our temptations to rage against an innocent lover - and remain sweet. We can recognise our attachment to guilt, shame and fear - and, after a wobble, keep faith with joy and trust. \n\nWe may have no option but to coexist with the unconscious, we would be foolish ever to underestimate its strength, but we can - with sufficient cunning, patience and observant and kind friends - move beyond being merely its slaves or its puppets."

      "title": "OUR LOVE OF UNAVAILABILITY",
      "text": "We are used to feeling pity or comic disdain for people who fall in love with those who are very obviously unavailable; for example, the obsessive teenager who swoons over a famous singer; the fan waiting outside the house of a celebrity who barely registers their presence as they make their way to their limousine; the stalker who has spent a decade tracking the movement of a star who couldn’t care whether they lived or died.\n\nWe laugh at the absurdity of the situation: to deliver one’s deepest wishes for intimacy to someone who doesn’t know one even exists. To develop feelings for someone one will never meet. To use a word like love - associated with cuddles, hand-holding and love making - for someone who is many hundreds of miles away and has only scorn or disgust for one.\n\nYet this mockery can shield us from an uncomfortable reality: how much closer we may be to this sort of love of the unavailable than we imagine. We too may, in a surreptitious manner, also be drawn to those who are not there for us in any meaningful way.\n\nOur chosen loves aren’t necessarily film stars. We aren’t in love with an elusive singer. We have no interest in legendarily athletes. But this doesn’t put us in the clear. For if we look more closely, there is one thing that our loves have in common with those of delusional fans: they are not able to offer us what we claim to want.\n\nThe reasons for their unavailability are subtle and quasi-invisible. They are unavailable because, though they are physically present, their minds and hearts aren’t free. They are married to someone else. They are drunk most evenings. They never stop finding fault with us. They are addicted to porn - or the news. They sleep with us but won’t let us know when they are next around. They’re out with their colleagues all the time. They still haven’t introduced us to their family. They want to see us but only as friends (unless they’re bored).\n\nThere are, in other words, different ways of being unavailable, some less obvious than others. But the net result is the same: we are substantially in love with a ghost. \n\nWhy might we be drawn to the tedium and pain of unavailability, even in its less stark forms? Why would we be detained by absence when the entire ostensible purpose of love is to connect?\n\nBecause there are in truth a great many upsides to unavailability.\n\nAn unavailable peron will never call us out because they never really cared for us. They won't judge us because they don’t see us. They won’t reject us because they never accepted us. They won’t spark disappointment because they never allowed us to hope. They won’t frighten us with their absence because they never graced us with their presence. They won’t harm us the way a parent might once have done because they don’t allow us to be close the way a proper partner would. They don’t force us into the terrors of love because they never properly partake in its joys. \n\nThe difficulty is that we may be entirely unaware of the scale of our peculiarities. We cannot reduce our fears because we don’t know the extent to which we are in their grip, we can’t get better because we don’t know how unwell we are.\n\nWe are too good at covering our tracks. We tell ourselves our situation is difficult but only temporarily and rather coincidentally. We put it down to a spot of bad luck. There are signs that things might improve. Our lovers do know our names; they are around a little. Things were great at the start seven years ago.\n\nBut we should compare ourselves more pointedly with stalkers and fans. We should reflect on a simple but acute question to measure the health of our situation: is the person I am interested in as committed to me as I am to them? Am I loved as much as I love?\n\nIf we cannot give a plain and immediate answer, if it turns out that (for whatever plausible sounding reason), the interest isn’t balanced and our faith in the relationship is founded more on what it could be rather than what it is, we should question our commitment to the love we say we seek. We aren’t innocently in a spot of romantic bother: we are below the surface systematically building a life in which tenderness cannot reach us.\n\nWe should be more curious about the obsessive fan we claim to have nothing in common with. The lure of unavailability is the same whatever form it takes, whether it focuses on a famous singer or an unknown person who nevertheless leaves very quickly after sex and never finds time to reply to our messages.\n\nWe should note too how much more interested we are likely to be in such people than in the warmer, more responsive types who regularly enter our orbit without us properly noticing, the kind who want to give us affection, tell us we are funny and interesting, are always reliable, but whom we not so coincidentally swiftly dismiss as ‘boring’ or ‘unsexy’ - code words for ‘overly likely to terrify us by their presence and sweetness’ or ‘unlikely to repeat patterns of suffering which feel both ghastly and compulsively familiar.’\n\nWe start to move away from quasi fandom when we accept how devoted we may be to a lack of mutuality, when we take on board a strange underlying idea: that we are terrified of love, that we are as threatened by hope as we are reassured by absence and impossibility."

      "title": "REASONS WE LIE IN LOVE",
      "text": "There is a particular kind of person in love who is highly liable to attract our unbounded hatred: the person who - though they have a partner, often a kind, tender and beautiful one at that - nevertheless feels compelled to look around, probably online, for hours, for alternatives. A person who is capable of laying on a cosy dinner with their partner, asking them about their day, disclosing a few things about their own, sharing news about their mother or sister and then, when the partner has gone upstairs to have a bath and finish a presentation, of picking up their phone and continuing a conversation with one of nine people they’re currently pursuing on an app.\n\nIt is hard not to let outrage subsume us. What pitiful flotsam. How miserable that a decent partner should be innocently unwinding in another room, looking forward to cuddling their beloved (hoping one day to marry them and perhaps even have a child with them), while, a few metres away, the numbskull is telling someone else (equally in the dark) how much they’d like to lie in bed in a hotel room reading them extracts of a favourite book. It seems an affront to everything we could have hoped for from love when we entered adult life; an apogee of amorality and spinelessness. \n\nThe outrage is easy to understand. It’s also very unhelpful - if we set ourselves the challenge of trying to work out why people do what they do, as opposed to what we hope they could do, in order to seek a route out of the worst of their behaviour.\n\nThe standard explanation focuses on lust. The deceiver is motivated by horniness. They’re cheating because, due to a malignly addictive personality, sex with one person isn’t enough.\n\nThe real answer might be stranger. They are doing this because they are - chiefly - extremely worried. And what they are worried about - counter intuitively - is that they will be let down by the partner they are letting down. They are cheating with nine other people in order to mitigate their sense of acute danger that they are going to be cheated upon, or at least violently disappointed, by the partner they are hoodwinking.\n\nThey have picked up their phone as a form of defence against their partner’s occasionally offhand manner, occasionally delayed messages, occasionally brusque responses. Other people are being called in as a form of emotional hedge, as protection against a perceived risk of devastating disappointment, as a highly curious way to mitigate a terror of abandonment. The additional candidates are ways of saying in effect: you can’t hurt me, I don’t mind when you don’t reply to me, I’d be safe if you were to find someone else, I don’t have to be upset with you when you seem distracted, I have alternatives were you to turn on me.\n\nIf some of us are frightened enough to behave like this, it’s generally because what we fear in the present has already occurred to us in the past. We are extrapolating from grim experiences. We don’t trust now, because we were let down then. We are driven to keep multiple options in play to be sure of preventing any recurrence of the kind of dependence we once endured at the hands of one or two people who hurt us very badly.\n\nSmall children have nowhere to go if mummy were to turn sarcastic and distant. Were daddy to scream and start throwing the coffee table across the room, there wouldn’t be alternatives. Were a parent to move in with a colleague and start a new family in another country, there would be no option but devastation. From such experiences, conclusions unconsciously form: you must never fully trust in anyone’s promises. Deception is rife. You cannot securely place yourself in the hands of any single person. You must protect yourself from the follies and viciousness of the few by reliance on a shifting array of the many. You must download some apps. At the slightest sign of disappointment or ambiguity, look elsewhere and say, in effect, never again. Never again will I wait and hope, never again will I tie myself to someone who could ruin my world on a whim.\n\nThat’s why we’re telling a minibus load of other people that we care about them; because there have been a few arguments; because the partner was forty-five minutes late calling, because there hasn’t been sex in fifteen days, because they were notably unfriendly or at least offhand at the party… We’re trying to contain anxiety in the only way we know how.\n\nNone of this is an excuse. To move on, we might become more attentive to the exact moment when we can no longer resist picking up our phone. It’s when the partner has gone on a business trip, when we mentioned we’d love to go on an outing and they kept not responding to the hint. It’s not when we are horny, it’s when we are overwhelmed by doubts we are too proud to admit to. There would - we can come to see - be alternatives: to do our partner the honour of calmly telling them how worried we actually are. To verbalise our fears rather than act out a clumsy flight from them. To say to them and ourselves, in effect: loving someone is horrifying to me; every day brings new questions and vulnerabilities, it scares me so much that I cannot have complete certainty, I’ve not learnt how to sensibly master how risky love feels and in some ways necessarily is. I don’t want to betray you, I am trying - like an idiot - to find a way to safety. \n\nNone of it makes the shiftiness remotely decent; it might nevertheless help to know that betrayal may at times disguise a highly confused, highly hurtful search for a way out of a legacy of betrayal.\n\n"

      "title": "THE UNWITTING COMEDY OF RESORT HOTELS",
      "text": "Though not ostensibly places of comedy, there is something a little funny (in a gloomy sort of way) about the world’s resort hotels; the kind with seven swimming pools, carvery buffets, pillow menus, a turn down service and (especially when the establishment is far flung) a Provencal or Tuscan restaurant overlooking a reef. \n\nThe inadvertent comedy stems from the claim that implicitly runs beneath these hotels: that here you will, after leaving your credit card details, be guaranteed peace of mind. That here, thanks to the unceasing efforts of a highly trained team, all your needs will be taken care of. That here, at last, you will be happy.\n\nAnd happy for very solid reasons: because there are so many different varieties of baked goods at breakfast, because there are iced towels available at the pool, because gardeners are permanently clipping the bougainvilleas, because Mario makes exceptional drinks and because the spa can provide vibrational body mapping and a cacao surrendering ceremony.\n\nNone of this feels - at first sight - contentious. We’re used to drawing a tight connection between sizeable expenditure and contentment; it’s why MBAs and openings in private equity have good reputations.\n\nNevertheless, resort hotels provide a concentrated vantage point from which to observe an oversight in our grasp of human psychology. Of course a balcony facing an ocean can - at moments - raise our mood. There are times when the prospect of minigolf can significantly brighten an afternoon. It does take an especially melancholy mind not to see the upsides of a plate of profiteroles.\n\nBut to assume that material outlay can, on its own, fundamentally calm and alleviate our psyches has to it some of the naivety of a five year old attempting to make mummy (currently sobbing uncontrollably behind her locked bedroom door) happy by singing ‘Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star’. \n\nDespite their commitment to impeccable customer service, resorts are notorious for their confusion in the face of most forms of emotional distress.\n\nThey struggle when our spouse is no longer speaking to us after an incautious remark about their mother.\n\nThey look away from the argument that started at around the time the papaya arrived yesterday morning and has been gripping our couple silently ever since.\n\nThey can’t explain why sex now feels implausible, even embarrassing\n\nThey can’t assuage the anger that led us to punch the ice bucket and think of scattering the complimentary bath salts in their underwear drawer.\n\nWhat do we do with our romantic pains in the early morning, when the room is silent except for a room service trolley (or coffin) being slowly wheeled down an interminable corridor somewhere above our heads?\n\nDespite the extraordinary efforts of the management, the touching Fernando and the gracious Matilda at the front desk, there are no answers. There is the region’s longest bar and deepest pool and the grandest inhouse bakery, and still no salves for the pains of the heart.\n\nWe can laugh darkly at our resorts because we are collectively so good at solving our material problems and so recklessly unambitious about addressing our psychological ones; because we chose to travel to the moon long before we understood how to have happy marriages, because there are three buttons to press when we need a hand towel origami and none at all when we are frightened, ashamed and alone. We are still waiting for the truly ‘luxurious’ hotels of the future, that is, hotels devoted to carefully understanding and imaginatively responding to the difficulties of being alive."

      "title": "Happiness Is Not a Still Image",
      "text": "It’s a curious feature of the way we imagine the future, especially its happy varieties, that we typically base our impressions on just one or two still images – as if happiness is not a destination we travel through in time, but a single frozen scene we might one day inhabit. Enormous plans that determine the shape of major chapters of our lives (and that might involve lengthy educational commitments, legal obligations, years of sacrifice and so on) may be set in motion with, and be guided by, nothing more searching or detailed than a handful of internal postcards.\nFor example, when we think of the word ‘retirement’, we might picture a cottage, a view onto the sea, a clear sky and a path down to some cedar trees. ‘Marriage’ might bring to mind simply a kitchen, a kindly figure by the stove and a softly lit dining table. ‘Children’ might prompt a picture of a playground and a smiling small person on a swing. ‘Success’ might summon up the lobby of a black lacquer-panelled hotel decorated in a faintly East Asian style.\nOur proclivity to picture our goals in terms of still images is especially apparent when it comes to travel. We might formulate a wish to go to ‘Greece’ (a journey involving an enormous outlay and complex logistics) and see just a whitewashed village, some blue fishing boats in the harbour and a windmill on a hillside. ‘Switzerland’ might be folded into a chalet in the snow; ‘Vietnam’ might disappear into a section of the beach at Hoi An at dusk.\n\nPhoto by Cristiano Pinto on Unsplash\n\nWhen Reality Refuses to Stay Still\nBut as we are made aware whenever we actually activate our plans, reality has a peculiar habit of revealing itself to be far more dense and multiple than our projections envisage. We may fantasise in terms of still images without any sound; but we have to live in real time in an entirely unedited (and uneditable) roll of moving film, which has not only a soundtrack (indeed ten soundtracks), but also a direct feed from our bodies – our stomachs, our limbs, our backs – as well as a restless jumbled stream of subtitles that look simultaneously backwards and forwards, that ask no end of strange questions, that wonder why we exist, that compare our condition with those of friends and rivals, and that ceaselessly wish we could be elsewhere and might have done something else with someone else in another place.\nIf we were to go to Greece, we’d quickly find that the postcard that had inspired our trip was part of a far more panoramic and demanding work that also comprised a long unair-conditioned wait at the airport, a giant advertisement for ouzo by a baggage carousel, a cramped yellow taxi down to Piraeus, a set of mournful reflections about our family while waiting in line for water, a traffic jam in a suburb full of smashed warehouses inhabited by gangs of stray cats, a panic about an email to a colleague at a traffic light, another wait by a putrid-smelling jetty, a stomach ache in a cramped toilet on the ferry to Samos, pulses of nostalgia for our old job in a bakery by a snorkel shop, insomnia by a bank of air conditioners – &nbsp;and so on and so forth.\nThe Turbulence of Love\nThe lesson is as humbling when it comes to love. In our single state, we dream of ‘having a partner’ and latch on to nothing more than an out-of-focus image of a smiling elegant face on our sofa. And then, after interminable rounds of dating, we might finally begin a story with William or Samantha, Petra or Luis, and recognise that our feelings for them might contain, in five minutes, more variety than we had imagined could fill a conjugal lifetime. We like them a lot, then we doubt them, then we wonder if they are mocking us, then we remember our ex with fondness, next comes a sexual fantasy, followed quickly by a burst of disgust, then a longing to marry them, then a desire to run away, then a wish to embrace them and never let them go. And this might still only have covered the period from 7.08 to 7.10 a.m.\nThe multiplicity is exhausting and untenable. To escape it, we pretend, to ourselves and the world, that we are solid propositions. We say: ‘This is my girlfriend or boyfriend.’ Or: ‘Here is my partner.’ We plan marriage. We say: ‘I love you.’ We don’t add (for now, for this instant…).\nWe are made largely of water, and our personalities are as viscous and evasive. We’re nothing but an alternating succession of moods. Keen students of the functioning of our minds know that our more fixed pronouncements can only ever be cover stories. The heart is intermittent. The married person continues to doubt. The one who rejected still somewhere adores. Declarations of love are followed, in short order, by renewed mental peregrinations. Hatred contains its opposite. We cycle through seventeen emotions before breakfast.\nHappiness Is Not a Destination\nWe live among many solid things and long to confuse ourselves with them. But we can’t, in the end, be statues, boulders or rocks. We are flightiness, we are fog, we are fast-flowing streams and clouds. We yearn for certainty and must make our peace with doubt, flickering and static – and in doing so remember that happiness is not a destination, but something shifting and momentary that we pass through, lose, regain and reinterpret as we move."

      "text": "Immanuel Kant, the legendarily stern and guarded German philosopher who attempted to reorganise human affairs according to patient and elevated principles of reason and logic, allowed himself – towards the end of his life – a rare moment of exasperation with our species. In a phrase that deserves to be heard in the emphatic original, he wrote:\nAus so krummem Holze, als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, kann nichts ganz Gerades gezimmert werden.\n‘Nothing completely straight can ever be made from the crooked timber of humanity.’\n\nPhoto by Nikola Mihajloski on Unsplash\n\nWe are – to hammer the point – an unholy mess. Families are furnaces of silence and rage, tyrants are never far from power, happiness is intolerable, every step forward automatically leads to a renewed exploration of stupidity, any sustained act of goodness must be punished – and we have an outstanding genius for destroying the most promising moments with sadism, regret and anxiety.\nLove and the Art of Being Crooked\nKant’s dictum may not have been particularly aimed at lovers, but it lends itself especially well to their ceaseless peculiarities. In few other areas do we long for ‘straightness’ as intensely – or is our strangeness and perversity so exhaustingly in view. We claim, in our daydreams, to want nothing more than calm and goodness. We deliver speeches in praise of a simple life. We think of ourselves as straightforward, decent – and easy to please. We promise to be good, if only we could find ‘the one’.\nThen we are graced with the sweetest and keenest soul; and – in short order – wreck them without restraint or explanation. We are terrified of losing them; and feel constricted as soon as they commit. Loneliness terrifies us; company suffocates. We vow to be infinitely grateful if they were to look our way; we wonder, in shorter order, if we couldn’t do a bit better. We build a happy home; and compulsively raze it to the ground. We promise to adore them till the end; and fondle their best friend in a lay-by. We begin full of appreciation; and end up irritable and paranoid. We give them everything; and are accused of limiting their freedom. We double our efforts to be affectionate; and come across as weak. We sit with them by the lake and tell them they resemble an angel; and they let out a small, oddly musical, high-pitched fart.\nThe Crooked Timber of Humanity\nIn the hands of a skilled carpenter, a plank of wood can be sawn and sanded into a summit of symmetry and precision. A chair can be made to stand on exquisitely slender, curved legs. Oak drawers can sail on invisible hinges to the gentlest of stops. Walnut commodes can remain unblemished for five hundred years.\nHuman affairs are open to no such engineering. Our laws may sometimes cooperate with our yearnings for neatness and purity. We can make a few renderings of paradise. We can draw up one or two ideal cities. For a few years, order may hold. One or two parks can be beautiful. We can – on paper – train 100,000 words to be exactly where they should be.\nBut humans aren’t, in the end, paragraphs; entire lives cannot be fashioned like maple or mahogany. We do not escape catastrophe. Misery is the rule.\nKant’s aphorism is an invitation to comedy. To fill the gap between our ideals and reality, the only dignified option may be to laugh – very darkly and every day. We wanted to be content; the divorce papers will be with us next week. We thought the gentle person with the beguiling eyes would save us; they’re getting married to a rival next summer. We finally learnt to trust them; they left shortly after. We were sure that spending a thousand euros on a beautiful room with a view to the mountains would allow us to reconcile and prove the strength of our love … It’s laughter or the asylum.\nWell-aimed pessimism can usher calm; it might even make us a little happier. Aware of what is possible, we might stop feeling so persecuted by reality; we can take a more benign view of the waves of bleakness that roll in (of course they left, naturally they lied, obviously dinner was a disaster); we can gently step down from our more punishing and unwarranted fantasies.\nWhat’s more, we can discover that we are in broad and good company. The communal script may speak of weddings and golden anniversaries; the reality is quietly bleak for everyone. No one gets through unscathed. We all end up suffering abysmally; we all watch our finer dreams implode, waste years wading through mud and confusion, wonder if we might be crazy (or may be being punished for having killed a child in a past life), we hope for purity, only to be met with paradox and evasion.\nWe can laugh richly once we let go of our more earnest and unwittingly cruel hopes. Nothing straight was ever promised or will ever hold. We’re a very wicked, exceptionally silly animal – the true crooked timber of humanity – as crooked as the worst bristlecone pine, and as ineffectual and irritating as sawdust.",

      "text": "At any given point, there are a huge number of people who are as single as we are; there are, in theory at least, plenty of people we might go out with. However, due to the psychology of attraction, the numbers we are able to ‘see’ – that is, recognise as viable, love-worthy candidates – are generally far smaller. Most of the apparent candidates are, in reality, entirely invisible to us. We may go on dozens of dates and return home sure of one thing: there is simply no one out there.\nWe tend to assume that our assessments are unanalysable and fixed. It’s just a taste, we say – a mute impulse beyond enquiry. ‘Attraction’ can’t be accounted for. But the logic of our selection can bear more scrutiny. It isn’t merely a mysterious or narrowly physical verdict: whom we ‘see’ out in the world is, in large measure, a reflection of our own psychological evolution. We ‘see’ – that is, assess favourably and start to desire – those who have reached a similar stage of emotional development as we have (while we remain blind to those who are either far in advance or far behind us). We may claim that our attraction is only ever about ‘looks’, but this reverses causality, failing to account for the intensity with which certain kinds of faces draw us in while others, objectively equally symmetrical, leave us cold. We declare ‘beautiful’ those faces that hint at psychological qualities we have learnt to accommodate in our hearts.\nThe Gradual Education of the Heart\nThe process can take years to perceive. At the age of fifty, we might look back on ourselves at twenty-five and remember someone who was interested in us. They had a pleasant appearance; they were lively and curious; they gave us their time – but we weren’t able to ‘see’ them at all. They left us cold. We may have run away from them. We might have described them as ‘a bit boring’ or ‘not sexy enough’. We might even (inadvertently) have wounded them rather badly.\nFrom a more mature vantage point, we begin to appreciate that there wasn’t just a mysterious taste or undiscussable impulse at play. We didn’t ‘see’ the value of the person because of where we happened to be in relation to ourselves. Perhaps we were frightened by warmth and kindness; it wasn’t what we were used to. We came from a background of neglect whose impact we hadn’t understood. We felt suspicious of a sweetness that felt foreign and unearned.\nAlternatively, we might remember turning away another person who was sexually open and giving. But at twenty-seven, sex was daunting for us; our capacity for excitement laid us open to too much vulnerability – and so we moved on, registering only a surface complaint about them living too far away or not sharing our hobbies.\nIf similar people came into our lives now, we would be ready. We would see them and their virtues clearly. We would have learnt not to hold it against someone that they were kind. We would have worked through our masochistic impulses. We would have overcome our interest in chilly, unreliable types. We would have grown more at ease with physical affection and sexual exploration. We would be ready to ‘see’ so many more good people – because we had grown up.\nThe Psychology of Attraction and Emotional Growth\nPart of the problem with ‘seeing’ more accurately is the regret it can unleash. We needed another decade before we didn’t panic when someone was thoughtful with us; it took us twenty years not to judge someone as deficient when they were principally loyal and even-tempered.\nAn analogy can be drawn between this process of romantic ‘seeing’ and travel. At twenty, when we first went to Venice, we may not have seen very much at all. We knew there were a lot of churches and palaces, but they went by in a blur; there was no room in ourselves for them. We followed the history books dutifully, but the details set off no deeper resonances. We left after two days. But by sixty, we know what to look out for when confronted by a baroque church. We’ve got a place in our hearts for an altarpiece by Bellini. There’s somewhere to put information about trade routes and government factions and the rise and fall of states. We ‘see’ so much out there because there is so much more room within.\n\nGiovanni Bellini, Madonna and Child between Saints Catherine and Mary Magdalene, c. 1490\n\nSeeing More, Loving More\nIt is poignant when, at a late age, we fall in love with someone we know we would have completely ignored had we met them any earlier. We would have been too frightened to deal with their sexual openness; we would have been too interested in torment to be able to stomach their warmth of spirit; there was too much chaos inside us to be able to appreciate their tranquillity. We know both how right they are, and how easily we would have looked through their qualities for most of our lives.\nThere could be so many more people to love – once we learn to ‘see’ goodness and maturity. And an equal number of people to run away from, once we lose our interest in suffering and torment. To grasp the psychology of attraction is to understand that love depends not only on who others are, but on how far we ourselves have come.",

      "text": "There are plenty of options that press themselves forward for consideration as the most romantic phrase we could ever utter to someone: I will never leave you; I feel utterly seen by you; you are incomparably beautiful…\nBut we may need to go down another, more surprising, sterner route to really honour the enquiry. If we define ‘romantic’ in an effective sense – meaning helpful to the survival and enhancement of love – then we may need a very different approach; then we may need a sentence like:\n‘If you ever stop being nice to me, I will leave you in short order.’\nIt may sound brutal on first reading: bitter, paranoid and jumpy – far from what we imagine romantic to mean. There must be a mistake.\nBut, with a few ghastly experiences behind us, we’ll know that this is precisely what we may need to say, in a kindly but confident voice, if the qualities on display in the sweet opening moments of love – tenderness, kindness, consideration, thoughtfulness, politeness – are not to give way, in time, to scratchiness, irritability, neglect and infidelity.\n\nPhoto by Pixabay on Unsplash\n\nThe Truth About How We Are Treated\nIt’s a bitter truth that other people treat us more or less exactly in line with the way we imply that we can bear to be treated. Lovers sense one another’s limits and will push relentlessly forward until they reach them. If we send out signals that we will – reluctantly but passively – take mystery, take unfair accusations, take a lack of effort, take cancelled plans and take the constant intrusions of a gang of mean-minded friends, then – cruelly – this is precisely what we will end up having to deal with. Our furniture will be scratched; our fridge emptied; our patience exhausted. The human animal – in all its perversity and sinfulness – subtly, intuitively adjusts to precisely the expectations placed upon it by its partners. We do as much as, and not a jot more than, we are called upon to do. We’ll do manners when manners have been insisted upon and casual, impudent disrespect when they haven’t. We’ll do apologies when these have been set as the price of peace – or otherwise sulk and throw blame around. As teachers with impeccably behaved classrooms have long known, the audience adjusts itself to whatever expectations have been defined. Those who signal big consequences seldom have to mete them out.\nThe Reassurance of Boundaries\nSurprisingly, though such intentions may sound harsh, no one especially minds. They may even feel immensely grateful – and more loving. It can be profoundly reassuring to be in the presence of people who promise to protect us against our own sloppiness, who restrain our temptations to decadence, who are on the side of our more exigent hopes for ourselves. No child actually likes an adult who will let them do anything – and nor does a lover.\nHalf the population have known this in their bones from the start. The wisdom began on the first day of school: don’t let them mess with you for a moment. If they touch a hair on you, they won’t know what hit them… Those who were protected by others grow into native experts at protecting themselves.\nThe rest of us – the ones who wasted a decade or two in shenanigans with sweet-faced monsters – need to learn the lessons the hard way, waking up in appalled wonder after our bank account has been emptied or our partner vanishes with someone they had an affair with online. Those with a bad childhood must suffer twice: the first time in the childhood itself, the second from the expectations of ill-treatment that they silently bring to bear upon their adult relationships.\nThe next time we begin a love story, we must be immensely kind, of course. We must listen, we must invite them out, we must remember special occasions and send sensitive messages. But we must also defend ourselves with a lion’s strength against their – and our own – temptations to cruelty. We will only make love truly flourish by insisting, very tenderly, early on, that we will simply tolerate nothing else.",

      "title": "THE GREATEST PARADOX OF LOVE",
      "text": "It’s the greatest paradox of our emotional lives. Let’s try to lay it out with compassion and patience. It appears that all we want is love. We claim to long for love so deeply, and to rue its absence so much. Our entire culture is devoted to framing love as an unquestionably desirable, unquestionably coveted quality. And yet from close up, it appears that we don’t want love in any pure and simple way, that the situation is far more complicated and perverse than we recognise, that we are deeply conflicted around love: that we both want it and don’t want it; that we are both craving it and terrified of it. \n\nTo follow our actual behaviour, we are subject to huge alarm about being accepted, cherished and held tightly. We both long for, but then are privately repulsed by, many potentially viable candidates whom we variously dismiss as insane, boring, stupid or ugly when they are not - in reality - remotely any of these things. We abhor our loneliness, but when someone comes along to rescue us from it, we develop nausea, we cause arguments about nothing, we identify a thousand flaws. Something restless and crazed stirs in us. We search around for something, anything, to spoil our prospects. We will not let ourselves accept the love we have apparently yearned for for so long.\n\nIn a bid to align our external reality with our internal shame and confusion, we seek some reason, any reason, why they are wrong. It never takes long. Humans don’t come in perfect forms. There will always be something to latch on to: they have the wrong qualifications, their nose is odd, there’s something up with their mouth, they laugh too much, they don’t laugh enough, they went to the wrong school, their friends are weird, they are too young, they are too old, their shoes are too pointed, they’re too rich, they’re too poor. We’ll get there. We’ll find a reason why they had to go. And our friends - innocent bystanders to the real psychological strangeness at play within us - will generally swallow the explanation without complaint. ‘Of course, what a pity, they did seem nice but fair enough, let’s hope there might be someone at the party on Saturday. Have you downloaded the new app…?’\n\nWhat is happening? We can describe the phenomenon intellectually - though the emotional echo will take years to make sense of in ourselves. We cannot properly or cleanly chose someone who loves us if we were not - ourselves, as children - chosen unambiguously by our parents. And, tragically, some parents, many parents, do not choose their own children. They collaborate to put a child on the earth and then - appallingly - their hearts are blocked when the little one arrives. They are depressed, they are elsewhere, they feel jealous (of a lamb sized person), they are deep inside their own sadness and darkness. They turn on the child. They find fault constantly with their own offspring. Don’t ask so many questions. Stop singing. Your hair looks daft. Toughen up. The baby is too fat, the baby is too thin, the baby has a funny nose or unappealing hands, the infant is stupid, the toddler is disgusting, the sister is better, the brother is cleverer. None of it has to be said exactly. It all gets transmitted nevertheless. Let’s not for a moment imagine that a race that can produce Mozart and Tolstoy and picks up on nuances in the paintings of Cy Twombly or Turner is anything other than very, very sensitive. Even the most mediocre mind has the porousness and depth of a genius. Whatever we chose to do with the data, we’ll feel as much as Kafka or Emily Dickinson. So the message gets through. There is something wrong with me, I am not chosen, I am in some way disgusting, I am a stain. I don’t deserve to be here.\n\nIf you were to ask an audience of a hundred people (and we carefully have) who might be able to relate to this hideous feeling, the bedrock sense of being weird and horrible, a feeling that’s been there since the start, around a quarter will (timidly) put up their hands. \n\nWhat is harder to trace is the impact of this feeling on relationships. For a long time, the full consequences can stay very hidden. Most people we meet are going to be wrong for genuine reasons (they really do have different interests, they actually are very aggressive etc.). So it can take an age to see that, alongside the objective challenges, we are also, deep down, out to deliberately sabotage promising situations, that we’re out to throttle love in the backyard of the mind, that we can’t take being approved of, that it’s too strange, frightening and eerie to be chosen by someone kind, that a demon in us is plotting for us to spend the rest of our lives either alone or circling emotionally-deranged unavailable tormentors.\n\nEventually, after having shot down the situation with A, rejected B, destroyed C, run away from D and hovered exhaustingly around E who was in love elsewhere, we may be ready for a little insight. At around 3.30am, we may come to the conclusion: I’ve got an illness, an illness with no (as yet) definable name. I keep finding flaws with people who love me. I keep blowing up perfectly viable situations. I keep swallowing up years circling people who can’t and don’t choose me. I am magnetically drawn to people and situations who recreate for me a primal feeling of not being chosen. \n\nWhat can - in the very best of situations - happen next? Finally, after a pile of bodies has been carried away, we may start to do what was never done for us. We forgive people for being human. We look around and see that, despite our terrors, there are one or two solid candidates we could love. Yes, their nose is a bit odd. Does it really matter? Of course, they didn’t go to the best university. Can’t they be clever enough anyway? We see certain flaws and we love them anyway. We realise that the reason why we’re tempted to throw everyone kind in the pit isn’t because they’re horrific but because someone threw us away. And we rebel - finally - against the injustice we were shown. We replace hyper criticism for others with sorrow for ourselves. There’s liberation in the tearful anger we can finally feel for our situation. We’re not going to do this anymore. We were bullied and thereby acquired a merciless kind of cynicism about human nature (it’s why we can be so funny at picking holes in people, and have been since school), but we’re going in another direction. We want to become interested in a love that is about tolerance. We may never have given Christianity too much attention till now (and still don’t care for it really) but we may get mightily interested in all this talk of acceptance and forgiveness and not minding if they have (as it were) leprosy.\n\nWe may say to ourselves in the darkness: I want to break the pattern. I don’t want to keep finding fault with others because others found fault with me. I will sit with my rabid desire to run away - and not run. I will feel the emotion to disembowel their character and ignore it. I won’t trust my nausea as a reliable guide to action any more. I will think of the little version of me who was unfairly treated instead. There’s nothing wrong with the person across the table. I’m suffering from a disease. I will listen to my instincts - then disregard them all.\n\nWe might even take a candidate gently and partially into our confidence. I like you a lot but this is very very frightening. I want you but a part of me sometimes wishes to run. It’s what I learnt to do in childhood. I’m a self-hating sort, I’m so sorry. \n\nIf they are a good candidate, they won’t panic. They’ll get the picture, even if the details are vague. They will help us to allow something new to emerge.\n\nWe may feel an appalling sense of regret for everything we’ve already destroyed; the extreme unfairness we’ve shown towards certain people whose only sin was to chose us. But, more hopefully, we’ll realise that there are more candidates than we suspected. We might have met them already. The chances of love are so much more widespread, once we can bravely recognise how scared we’ve been of them all along.\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "We don’t normally notice it; it’s a background fact that we aren’t in any position to register, let alone feel we can mention. It would be like complaining about gravity, time or clouds.\nBut then occasionally, at a moment of special vulnerability, the truth can burst through with special force: the modern world, the world of the last hundred years, is ugly – phenomenally, incontrovertibly, monumentally and unremittingly ugly. It’s ugly in Charleroi, Luton, Marbella, Katowice and Eindhoven; it’s ugly in Bakersfield, Fresno, Lima, Manila and Shenzhen. It’s repulsive in parts of Frankfurt, Cumbernauld and Lagos. A world that is so much richer, more democratic, kinder and more civilised has also grown desperately dispiriting to look at. We would need to be half-asleep not to notice it – and we are (we’ve had to be).\n\nPhoto by Johan Mouchet on Unsplash\n\nIt’s ugly because there are angular, blank-faced, quasi-military concrete apartment blocks spread all the way up to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada; because there are burnt-orange plastic warehouses urinated across the Po valley; because there are tangles of motorway between Taipei and Taoyuan; because the towers of Toronto speak in one voice of shiftiness and despair. There is aesthetic unanimity from São Paulo to Accra, Milton Keynes to Manama – an aesthetic of disregard, mockery and unkindness.\nThe Protective Layers of Distraction\nUsually, we have protective layers between us and the mess: our jobs, our relationships, our sense of haste (we need to be in Malaga by 12.40; there are seven calls we have to make before we reach Doha). We’re on our phones throughout the Uber ride; we’re negotiating for a later appointment at the urology clinic (we’re going to have another colonoscopy); we’re trying to get a point about tenderness across to our avoidant partner; we’re ordering another (longer) cable for the garden.\nBut we have our weaker moments: when we’re travelling alone, when we’re no longer quite sure what we’re trying to achieve with our careers, when we’ve been left in love and have four nights alone in the Sleepy Inn at the airport in Prague, when we have seven hours to kill in Phoenix or a layover in Algiers. That’s when we can no longer resist the messages that the ugliness has all along been beaming to us. We begin to hear what the warehouses, malls, condominiums, aircraft maintenance hangars, 24-hour gyms and indoor ski slopes have been telling us since around 1924. Messages like: no one gives a damn about you; you’re an incidental bit of soil in a giant fast-moving sewer of sadness and violence; you will die friendless, ugly, incontinent and irrelevant, and all you care about will be concreted over to make way for an eat-as-much-as-you-like buffet restaurant covertly funded by a Neapolitan crime syndicate.\nThe Unseen Visual Crisis\nWe know the planet is getting hotter; there are clever people measuring levels of CO₂ and ozone. But we’re still struggling to put into words what’s happening visually – what the turd-shaped glass office building is doing on the horizon, why there are purple and maroon sheds between here and the coast, why a building in the form of a chocolate-sprinkled bagel has gashed its way into the pine forest. Are we the problem? Or is this the last spasm of a peculiar yet legitimately incensed mind faced with an unnoticed planetary crime?\nLove as the Only Cure\nThe solution – it’s always the solution – is what we might as well call love. The kind of love when someone adds tracery to the ironwork on the balcony; when a patient mason locates just the right kind of beige limestone for the lintel; when the proportions remember the shape of our bodies; when someone decides not to make 45% profit so that seven million inhabitants can have a decent horizon; when a developer has been the recipient of enough sweetness early on that they do not clad the 67-storey tower with golden reflective windows. There’s love when someone remembers that we are, in the end, too fragile to take constant greed and discordance; when someone knows that we are as delicate as babies and have a terrifying journey to make through life and therefore need – very, very badly – the kind of repose and cosiness offered by a square with three palm trees by a fountain and a terrace of repeating townhouses by the canal.\nTo rub salt in, beauty isn’t even very complicated to produce. The principles of attractiveness in all the old parts of town could be summarised on a handkerchief. We’re like a civilisation that invented the most accomplished mobile phones, then threw away the rules, fetishised the old models and started selling one another nonsense in the shape of walkie-talkies glued together with sellotape – while not even noticing the peculiarity of what we were up to.\nIt&#8217;s likely that no one reading this has ever had or will ever have the power to design a new part of town. But at least we can know that we are not alone in suffering from what is going up and will continue to do so until the apocalypse. The best we might do is cry together, hold out a hand to our similarly suffering neighbour and say, ‘I know, I know…’. At least we’ve noticed how much we’re longing (very silently) for modest beauty – and how much ugliness can hurt.",

      "text": "The French seventeenth-century philosopher Pascal once observed that, had Cleopatra’s nose been just a few millimetres shorter, the history of the world would have been very different. By which he meant that, had the Egyptian queen been a bit less physically attractive, she wouldn’t have been able to charm both Julius Caesar and Mark Antony as she did – and Roman (and world) history would have taken another course.\nThe remark highlights something central to the psychology of attraction: the extraordinary and absurdly large role that physical appearances can play in our decisions – how much of our proclivity for certain people is founded not on considerations of reason or logic but on the call of aesthetic urges; on how prone we are to saddle ourselves with certain hugely perplexing candidates simply because we cannot, in the end, quite resist the way they look.\n\nStatue of a Ptolemaic Queen, perhaps Cleopatra VII, 200–30 B.C. Image credit: Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nThe Lies We Tell Ourselves About Desire\nIt’s understandable if we might protest at the humiliation and silliness involved – and lie a little as a result. We may insist, as much to ourselves as to others, that it isn’t remotely Cleopatra’s profile that interests us; we are serious people, after all. We have deep motives at play: we’re fascinated by the queen’s interest in Nubian music, her mastery of multiple languages (Plutarch said she spoke nine) and respectful of her excellence at calligraphy. In explaining why we have begun or ended a relationship, we reach for noble-sounding explanations: we frame our choice with reference to political tastes, career goals or artistic sensibilities. What we may not be able to bear is the extent to which it is ultimately their grey-green eyes that powers our interest – how we might spend ten years with an otherwise maddening person because of their charming jawline, their sweetly crooked teeth or intriguing trace of down on their upper lip. Just as it might be a pair of curious ears, an overly long nose or a set of drooping shoulders that came between us and an otherwise extremely fitting candidate.\nThe Unruly Logic of the Psychology of Attraction\nWe know only too well – rationally – how sensible it would be to get together with certain people who promise us, on paper, a life of serenity and tenderness. We know that this or that suitor is extremely intelligent; we would like nothing more than to reciprocate their interest; we are profoundly touched by their messages; we appreciate how convenient their backgrounds are and how useful it is that they have elegant apartments and fascinating friends. But we also know, deep down, that we simply cannot look past their forehead or frame, eyebrows or legs. We might try to convince ourselves otherwise across a succession of dinner dates before, finally, giving up after another strained kiss in the hallway. Just as we may be unable to keep away from the person we met at the nightclub who has none of the qualities we would ever need but whose hips we cannot get out of our minds.\nKingsley Amis compared a lifetime of having a libido to being ‘chained to an idiot’. We might add that the best way to cope with this knucklehead – who drags us to parts of town we shouldn’t be in, who sets up marriages that torment us and who makes us shed tears over ingrates we should have forgotten instantly – is to accept their dominion with grace.\nWe should, with Cleopatra’s Roman suitors in mind, be a little less ashamed of our buffoonery. Love is – despite our sensible hopes – an incontrovertibly daft enterprise that pushes us towards people and situations we would never have given time to, were it not for drives and motives that lie far outside our conscious control. The psychology of attraction ensures that we have no option but to do a succession of mad things in the name of noses that secretly charm us; we shouldn’t add to our follies by pretending that we could ever conclusively escape them.",

      "text": "Though we may think of the process as automatic and innate, the way we form relationships has shown radical changes across time – unlike the way we, let’s say, breathe, fall asleep or drink water. Love has a history, and we can – across the globe – distinguish two of its central phases.\nThe first, running from the dawn of time to the late eighteenth century, we might call the age of Material Relationships. In this period, we were inducted to form couples principally on the basis of pragmatic considerations: money, diplomacy, dynasty and children. You got together with someone not because you loved them, but because your family had a plough and theirs had an ox, because they were the nephew of the King of Naples and you were the niece of the Prince of Brabant, because someone had a fertile bearing and someone else had resources to raise a family. One didn’t – in the midst of this – expect to be especially attracted to, or respected by, a partner; being happy was close to the last thing on anyone’s mind.\nThen, starting slowly in parts of Western Europe, a new idea formed of what a relationship could be like. According to the tenets of Romanticism, the central purpose of coupledom was reimagined as being about mutual understanding, sexual fulfilment and communion with a unique soulmate. This soulmate was to be found not by following the advice of relatives or village elders but by adhering to the rapturous yet mysterious movements of one’s heart. Sudden decisions powered by inexplicable emotions became proof of being well matched (getting married after knowing someone for two weeks felt beautiful to the Romantic mind). It was key to accept someone in their totality: to be thought a good lover, one would need to adore someone exactly as one found them, with no wish to change a thing about them. True love wouldn’t require much conversation either; one didn’t need to use too many words to know a soulmate – one could simply intuit what was going on inside them by sitting with them in silence (perhaps near a waterfall or other sublime element of nature).\nWe are – most of us – the heirs of this powerful Romantic conception of love, promoted with enormous skill by films, poems and songs, and we have been encouraged to feel that it is a vast improvement over what came before. We recoil at the cold-heartedness of our ancestors who married for ‘sensible’ reasons, lived scratchily alongside one another and took their longings to the grave.\nThe Need for a New Approach to Love\nNevertheless, it’s hard to survive long into adulthood without a suspicion that there may be problems – even unwitting cruelties – involved in the Romantic approach to love. Do our feelings necessarily push us towards the most appropriate candidates? Judged by statistics, the most calculating dynastic considerations of the old world might have yielded no grimmer results than the dictates of our hearts. Does everyone have a soulmate? Is it always evil to want to change someone? Is it fair to expect that one should be able to understand a person without having to speak? Are pragmatic considerations always by the by? How high should expectations be?\nWe might go further. For all its promises, the Romantic age has – collectively – failed us very badly. Heightened expectations of love, combined with a ruthless suspicion of rational exploration and communication, have led to punishing degrees of loneliness and confusion.\nWe stand in need a new start: a third age of love, one that would synthesise the best elements of the preceding two movements. It would be pragmatic and reasonable, but in the name of happiness rather than status and dynasty. It would recognise the hopes of the Romantic age but give us tools and mental disciplines with which to stand a chance of attaining them.\nWe could call this the age of the Therapeutic Relationship – and it would have some of the following characteristics:\nEmotional education:\nThe age would start from the assumption that love was a skill, and not just an emotion – one that needed to be learnt very slowly and with much humility, in something like a School of Love.\nPsychotherapy:\nPsychotherapy would become the leading theoretical model by which we understood our romantic dilemmas. Therapeutic Relationships would be founded on the key insight of psychotherapy: that we cannot make sense of our adult lives without first looking at our childhoods, that the way we love as grown-ups follows closely along tracks formed before our tenth birthdays.\nUnpicking our distortions:\nIn a Therapeutic Relationship, two people would accept that they were the ineluctable heirs of distortions set up for them by their pasts. Someone might – in response to growing up around an angry father – have acquired an unhelpfully timid or evasive nature; someone else might – after a let-down from a mother – be tempted to have multiple partners to insulate themselves from disappointment. Therapeutically minded people would not be impatient or defensive about their neurotic aspects; they’d be especially committed to understanding and overcoming them. A standard enquiry on an early (therapeutic) dinner date would be: ‘And how are you mad?’ – the assumption being that everyone is, and only the most dangerous among us claim otherwise.\nWork:\nTwo lovers brought together under a therapeutic conception of love would have high ambitions: they’d want to understand one another, open their hearts and be content in each other’s company. But they would also be hugely modest about the chances of any of this ever happening spontaneously. They’d be careful students of love; they’d constantly apologise for the trouble they were bringing into their couple; they’d daily renew their efforts to know and be known. They’d go in for long conversations that would start with phrases like: I wonder why I always tend to… or I want to check-in on how you’re feeling about our last discussion… None of it would sound very Romantic – and that would be the point.\nA mistrust of feelings:\nTherapeutically minded people would be suspicious of using feelings as guides to the formation of couples, knowing that feelings tend to guide us first and foremost towards what is familiar, not towards what would make us happy. The child of an alcoholic may – under the sway of unexamined feelings – feel powerfully drawn towards another alcoholic who throws them once more into the doubts they knew when they were little; those who have been neglected as children may be manically attracted to partners who promise to leave them as unseen and unheard as they used to be. Therapeutically minded people would be resistant to the call of love at first sight. They’d know that, after a childhood of suffering, initial feelings of nausea in someone’s company might merely mean that one had, at last, chanced upon someone who promised to be kind.\n\nPhoto by Andrea Davis on Pexels\n\nThe Promise of Therapeutic Relationships\nIt seems we have two choices in love. We can expect very little – and then get very little in return. Or we can expect a lot, but then need to be ready for an immense amount of hard work to realise our ideals.\nRomanticism refused the equation: it taught us to expect ecstasy but then gave us no mechanisms by which to achieve it. Therapeutic Relationships recognise and seek to correct the conundrum. They propose that happiness might be possible – but then soberly insist that it would require no less effort to bring about than would be needed to master a foreign language or a musical instrument.&nbsp;",

      "text": "We don’t generally connect the way we love with the way we believe. But it’s worth keeping in mind that the historical moment when we first started to place emphasis on love between earthly couples was almost exactly the moment when we ceased to stress the love of humans for their gods. Societies gave up on their fervent attachments to the supernatural at about the same time as they redirected their energies towards venerating their fellow humans. Dating replaced Scripture, and a new age of romanticism and religion took shape – one where devotion was redirected from the divine to the human.\n\nFra Angelico, Annunciation of Cortona [detail], c. 1433–1434. Source: Sailko/Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)\n\nIn nineteenth-century Europe, the gradual emptying of churches followed – very closely – the movement of ideas we know as Romanticism, with its fixation on the ecstasies of interpersonal relationships. We started to believe in Earthly Love at around the very time we gave up on the Heavenly variety. Just as we began to scoff at the notion of winged deities, we started referring to one another as ‘angel’ as we called upstairs for help with the groceries or asked where the keys were.\nIf there has been any risk in this, it has to do with ambition and disappointment. Gods are, by their nature, far better at absorbing hopes than our fellow humans. True angels stay well out of the way. They don’t forget the milk; they aren’t late picking up the children from school. They provide a rarified focus of attention in which the compromises of daily life never intrude. They keep love pure. They have very tender eyes and (often) faraway, beguiling glances. They offer us ecstasy free of the blemishes of routine.\nRomanticism and Religion\nReligious societies – in their identification of love with the divine – provided their members with a hugely intelligent buffer against disappointment. By telling us that we could not build Jerusalem here on earth, in our own bedrooms and kitchens, they kept our eyes fixed elsewhere: on the heavens, and on an era beyond our own. There were perfect beings, of that we were assured; we were just not about to meet them on the dance floor or in a library. As a result, we brought less intense and urgent expectations to other mortals. Of course another person wouldn’t be able to understand us completely; naturally we’d never be properly happy beside another human; how obvious that most partners would prove blunt, obtuse, often maddening and never quite beautiful enough. None of this was made to feel surprising, humiliating, or grounds for resentment or despair; it was prewritten in the contract of earthly life.\nThe Wisdom of Accepting Imperfection\nIn abandoning our churches and temples, we’ve brought a reckless, naive degree of hope to our interactions. It’s an irony that the secular like to accuse the religious of credulity; in love at least, the charge should be entirely reversed. Our songs do not stop celebrating the glories of our newfound loves; our divorce courts testify to reality.\nWe cannot go backwards. We cannot start to worship gods and angels from a secular place. But by noticing a little more clearly how deep our longings run, and how much we might be directing them upon very mortal and very compromised targets, we might spare our partners some of the intensity of our perfectionist yearnings. We might come to spend more time in thoughtful contemplation of the compromises of earthly life in the aisles of deserted churches, reflecting on romanticism and religion and lighting the occasional candle with tears in our eyes.\nTo realise that our partners truly aren’t angels may be the start of genuine kindness and tolerance – an act of near-godly wisdom.",

      "text": "We sometimes hear reminders about the importance of appreciating kind people. The people who are nice, who message you regularly, who ask how you are, who support your ambitions, who want the best for you. The ones who are thoughtful and don’t flare up – and who will write sweetly to you, hoping you have a good night.\nThe advice can sound remote, mechanical, sentimental. We suspect: surely there must be something wrong with these ‘good people’ if we need reminders to appreciate them. Surely truly good people – people we should really bother with – assert their value without any need for artificial prompts.\nBut this is to forget something key about human nature: that we tend to categorically –and very tragically – reject, ignore and trample upon goodness and niceness whenever it crosses our path. We are spoilt children who fail to pay heed to most of the glories we are gifted; who care so much more for drama and pain than repose and sweetness.\nLearning to Notice Everyday Goodness\nThere is no greater example of this than in our attitude to the beauty of our world. We omit to notice springtime, the light through the trees, the sky at dusk, the lemons on the sideboard, the path through the forest, the colours of the sea at the shoreline. We hardly pay attention to the summer or the dignity of autumn – and that is why we have, collectively, accorded such honour to those talented evocators of the world’s sublimity: Cézanne, Renoir, Pissarro, Van Gogh, Vermeer, de Hooch, Hammershøi and so on.\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, Spring at Chatou, c. 1873\n\nWe wouldn’t be so moved by their works if we weren’t normally so accustomed to look past what they are attempting to draw our attention to. Our respect for their art is, in part, a piece of self-criticism and atonement. We can read their canvases as an infinitely subtle attempt to tell us, in effect: look up at the sky as you walk to work; stop being so ungrateful to springtime; notice the hope and cheer available in a vase of flowers; enough of your focus on strife and ugliness.\nThe emotion we may feel in front of their paintings is bound up with a semi-conscious sense of how far we have let ourselves drift from what we should rightly love – if we were sane and thoughtful.\nAppreciating Kind People Before It’s Too Late\nMuch the same dispiriting ingratitude applies to people as it does to flowers or seasons. Here too, we grow inured to beauty. Here too, we fail to appreciate what is special. Here too, we need reminders. We need someone to say: stop taking generosity for granted. Don’t mistake calm for tedium. Properly pay homage to the glory of forgiveness. Go back and call the person you never thanked for their patience.\nInstead, we seem magnetically drawn to complicated, tormented types who remind us of other complicated characters we grew up around. It may be time to break the pattern and – in the same way as we momentarily vowed to do last spring in the poppy field or on our way out of the exhibition in Paris – remind ourselves to pay genuine homage to what, and who, is good, kind and true before it is too late.\nAppreciating kind people is not a sentimental act but a recognition that, in a world full of turmoil, gentleness is a form of quiet heroism. Life is too awful for us to treat niceness with anything other than wholehearted reverence.",

      "text": "In getting closely involved with other people, we may come up against a rather improbable-sounding&nbsp; but often very disruptive and painful phenomenon: the powerful need for someone to go back and repeat a stage of life that they may not – unbeknownst to them and certainly to us – have properly completed at the normal time. Missed emotional development stages can indicate a need for someone to go back and do lots of now rather age-inappropriate things (including, perhaps, leaving us), in order to accede, finally, to their proper adulthood.\n\nPaul Cézanne, Le Garçon au gilet rouge (Boy in a Red Waistcoat), 1888–1890\n\nA way to understand the phenomenon is to say that life has an emotional trajectory that is meant to unfold alongside biological evolution. Every decade of life can be associated with archetypal psychological developments that should, all being well, emerge in sync with physical changes. Between 0 and 10, for example, we typically learn about love, trust and self-esteem, picking up lessons about how to rely on others and how to speak our needs. Between 10 and 20, all being well, we learn about our position in social groups and, in the later part of that decade, through a lot of often messy experiments, about our power to sexually attract other people in safe and gratifying ways.\nWhen emotional development stages are skipped\nThe difficulty is that things don’t often go entirely well. All kinds of traumatic events can get in the way of someone completing their necessary emotional modules. There might be a war, an illness, an accident or an act of violence. What is worse is that it can be very hard for the person involved to understand the gap in themselves and therefore to warn those close to them of their lingering need to redo some missing years. Someone may – with great sincerity, at the age of 30 – present themselves to us as sharing in certain of the key emotional goals expected of a member of their generation. They can tell us with certainty that they want to settle down with one person, develop their identity outside of a friendship group and focus on their talents.\nBut, around 45 or 52, they may nevertheless be pulled powerfully in contrary directions. Despite marriage, children and responsibilities at work, a person may be drawn to ingratiating themselves with a social group made up of young people they met through a sporting club, or flirting randomly and dangerously with strangers, or redoing their wardrobe, going on dating apps and questioning their career. Though they may not be able to spell out what is happening to them in coherent terms for a long time, they are in essence having to go back and complete lessons that they skipped long ago, perhaps at the age of 15 when they happened (tragically) to have been assaulted or had to deal with a parent’s sudden death or a family bankruptcy.\nThe curriculum always returns\nThere isn’t really any such thing as being ‘advanced for one’s years’; it is only a cover term for being denied the growth that actual years should always allow for. We need in the end to do exactly what our biological decades ask of us, and, if we have raced ahead, we will simply have to go back and finish what was skipped. The emotional curriculum can never be rushed.\nIf our once-stable companion has now acquired a nose ring or ear stud and is dancing somewhere in town every night, we may get furious and sad of course – but it may, at the same time, be interesting and poignant to explore which emotional development stages they might have missed, and how they have come to need to be younger than they are, on the basis of traumatic events that long ago forced them to be older than they were.",

      "text": "For all their perils, rough childhoods tend to teach us something important about how to look after ourselves. We don’t expect to be pampered; distrust comes easily; we know about vigilance and a hard-heartedness; we don’t harbour too many illusions. And that’s why, despite the suffering they involve, rough childhoods tend to make us resilient and, in the world of work, often rather successful. We don’t expect anyone to solve our problems, we know that no one owes us much and we understand that there is no ship coming to rescue us.\nBut there is a notable exception to this worldly independent scepticism – and it comes in the area of love. How childhood affects relationships can be unexpectedly tragic Here we find, remarkably, that it’s precisely those who have had the hardest childhoods who may be the least prepared for the pitfalls of adult relationships. For all their wily intelligence and cynicism, the underloved can end up fatefully naive – and in danger – in the intimate sphere.\n\nPhoto by Katia Miasoed on Pexels\n\n— First and most importantly, the underloved person doesn’t – deep down – especially value themselves as an emotional being and is therefore unable to insist on good treatment from those close to them. Semi-consciously, they hunt out feelings of being ignored, sidelined and demeaned.\n— Never having been properly valued, the underloved tend to be far too patient around desperate romantic situations which healthier people would more cleanly recognise as such and leave behind in short order. They wonder – for months or years – whether a partner who is unsure or unfaithful might perhaps be persuaded to love them after all. They beg, they fantasise, they hope for changes of mind. They cannot muster the self-respect with which every properly loved child grows up. The underloved see nothing peculiar about spending years in the company of people who are cold, frustrating, dismissive and rude. It’s the most familiar of feelings; it’s just like home.\n— To survive a difficult childhood, the underloved had to stifle their outrage and scepticism. They couldn’t ask, with appropriate anger: Why don’t these caregivers love me? Instead, they had to turn the blame inwards and speculate: What might be wrong with me for not receiving better treatment (rather than with them for neglecting the person they brought into the world)? What an ugly and deformed wretch I must be to be treated as I am by my seniors! Such a perspective renders them experts at doomed patience. Why not wait five years for a partner to love them ‘properly’, given that they have already spent the first two decades hoping that a father or mother might be kind? The wounded are experts at creative excuses: Mummy isn’t just a bully, she’s got so much to think about. Daddy isn’t just a brute, he’s trying to teach me important things about life in a distinctive way. And later on: Perhaps Melanie is really a sweetheart, she just needs to have some affairs for a while… or I think Jack could be an angel, he just loses his temper badly sometimes… People who wouldn’t take a single excuse from a colleague at work develop – in love – the patience of rocks.\n— Having waited so long and forlornly for love in childhood, the underloved exercise none of the requisite care in assessing whether it is with them in true form in adulthood. They melt with daunting ease once someone mentions that they adore them. They follow what their partners are saying rather than doing. Surely the beloved must be nice; they’ve called them ‘darling’ and ‘sweet rabbit’. They can’t have malevolent intentions; they sent a three-line email with many kisses at the end. The underloved are so much in awe that someone has finally accorded them a few shards of the care they crave, they have no strength for due diligence. Unwilling to believe in fantasies for an instant in matters of work or politics, religion or medicine, they show extraordinary faith towards honeyed words and sentimental evasions in love.\n— Simultaneously, they harbour no hope that there could – with a little effort – be better to be found. Their own desirability is constantly in question. Having already been accorded bad parents, they cannot muster trust that they might have better luck finding people more decent than their current partners elsewhere. They stay rooted to the spot, as they always have done.\n— Overall, the underloved fail, in relationships, to ask themselves the most basic and necessary question: Am I happy here? They don’t believe in the right to their own peace. It wasn’t there in childhood, so why would it be any sort of vivid requirement now? They accept without complaint what they have long put up with: shitty treatment. They have none of the healthy person’s instinctive recoil from neglect. They are always trying to see the upside of desperate situations. They write long letters to their partners speculating on why they might be pulling away. They have an unending appetite for excuses. They don’t see withdrawal as a sign to leave at once – merely a riddle to be solved in encyclopedic detail over many upcoming years of pain.\n— And then, of course, on the other side, the underloved constantly shudder and feel nauseous in the company of sweet prospective lovers. Not only are they endlessly tolerant of the mean and the unsure, they are radically allergic to those who threaten to be tender and available. Why would anyone think any better of them than they think of themselves?\nIt’s bad enough that we should have had rough childhoods. It’s even sadder that we should – on that basis – still so often remain tolerant of inadequate lovers and resistant to the kindness we should have been gifted from the start. Understanding how childhood affects relationships can help us begin, at last, to choose love more wisely.",

      "text": "We are used to thinking of the success of love in stark and binary terms: either a relationship ‘worked’ – meaning we were, and stayed, happily together for a long time (possibly to the end) – or else it ‘failed’, leaving us in pain and feeling (more or less) that we wasted our time.\nThis may be far too punitive a vision. What if we were to shift our consideration away from whether a relationship lasted or not, towards a more salutary and interesting concern: how much we were able to learn about love as a result of an ending? We could come to draw value not just from the longevity and solidity of a bond, but from its capacity to teach us about our emotional needs in the course of its demise.\nWe might say that behind the collapse of every relationship, there are lessons that could be formulated and absorbed. Whereas we might currently assess a string of failed relationships as simply a mess, we might come to think of them as a storehouse of latent insights into the nature and purpose of love.\n\nEgon Schiele, Four Trees, 1917\n\nMapping the Curriculum of the Heart\nWe could reconfigure what our past relationships meant to us by asking ourselves: what were their central lessons? What did each one teach me? We might – on this basis – draw up an educational map of our entire romantic trajectory:\nLessons from M. (age 19–21):\n— Never be with someone out of a sense of obligation.\n— Get out as soon as you feel you need to. It is never kind to delay.\nLessons from Q (22):\n— No begging (ever). Ask a maximum of four times (nicely), then go.\n— Someone can be extremely clever and yet emotionally totally obtuse.\nFrom B. (22):\n— Careful of people who hide behind a sweet, ultra-polite manner.\n— Don’t always take their silence as a sign that they are happy.\n— Good sex really matters.\nFrom D (22–34):\n— Tell them clearly what you can tolerate – and mean it.\n— Be prepared to walk away at any time.\n— The most normal-seeming person might withdraw and go mad (because of issues in their deep psyche). Stay vigilant.\n— Don’t help anyone too much.&nbsp;\n— You deserve kindness and goodness.\n— Guard the citadel.\nFrom P. (37–43):\n— Desperation leads to bad choices.\n— Acquire an abundance mindset: there are always other people.\n— Don’t put up with anyone who isn’t very, very keen. Never persuade.\n— There is madness out there; beware mental issues.\nDating (44–50):\n— Second impressions are never any better.\n— You can and should be polite and elegant when exiting situations.\n— Beware the sunk cost fallacy.\n— Lack of confidence from childhood has a very long tail.\n— Forgive yourself for making every mistake in the book\nThe Hidden Value of Endings: Lessons to Learn in Love\nWhen we are next sobbing on the sofa or in bed, lamenting the ‘failure’ of another relationship, we should pause and gently ask: what am I able to learn here? What has the disintegration of this connection got to teach me? The collapse is a lesson in disguise. Maybe, on examination, there is a warning about the need not to compromise around sex. Maybe there is something we have to take on board about listening to our gut instinct. Maybe we have to go back and relearn a lesson about never trying to save someone, or about intellect being powerless in the face of emotional pressures.\nWe might say that the most awful break-ups are, by definition, also those with the richest possible educational material embedded in them. If we can’t (eight months after a break-up) still believe that we have been abandoned, it may only be because we’re failing to pick up (let’s say) a lesson about self-respect, or a module on developing intolerance for excuses.\nTurning Tears into Knowledge\nWe shouldn’t be offended by how simple many of the lessons on love can sound. That it should take five years to learn ‘Listen to your gut’, or a year and a half to learn ‘Set Boundaries’, or six months of agony and chaos to acquire the lesson ‘Give up on people who refuse to listen to you’ may sound silly. But there is an immense difference between how simple a lesson may sound and how vastly complicated it is to grasp properly – that is, to thread it through the details of our lived experience.\nThe philosopher Schopenhauer proposed that the task of philosophy should be to turn ‘tears into knowledge’. The more we value such knowledge, the less each collapsed relationship needs to be viewed as a waste. It isn’t just agony; it may also be a fascinating and important part of our romantic curriculum.\nWe can shift our definition of a good lover away from a paragon who has managed to discover their eternal soulmate, to someone who – despite an ongoing degree of pain – never stops learning about the complexities of love. The next time we suffer a romantic reversal, we don’t only need to curse ourselves for our bad luck; we can think that we had a few more lessons to learn in love before we could be left in peace.",

      "text": "Early on in our pursuit of love, we put it down to accident. We were unlucky. This or that one was randomly ‘off the rails’ or ‘slightly crazy’. It can take a long while to understand that the problem is endemic – and that it points us towards a deeper truth about how childhood trauma affects adult relationships.\nWe can analyse the universal predisposition of our partners to what we can colloquially call ‘madness’ like this. All of us were brought up in unbalanced environments. All families of birth are cauldrons of disturbance. There is always something: a depressed mother or an angry father; a closeted sadist; a vengeful moralist. There was someone who couldn’t bear vulnerability or who needed exaggerated signs of purity or social success.\n\nVincent Van Gogh, Two Cut Sunflowers, 1887\n\nLittle children are hardwired to adapt themselves to survive in challenging circumstances. Helpless and fragile for a long time, they have an innate sensitivity to what any family requires in order not kill or eject them – and so will develop ingenious strategies to draw in the affections of their flawed caregivers. They feel their way to whatever is needed in order to be housed and fed for that first crucial decade.\nThe Inheritance of Madness: How Childhood Trauma Affects Adult Relationships\nIn response to raging parents, they develop a manic capacity to smile weakly and please. To deal with a depressed mother, they become jokers. To negotiate a jealous father, they take early retirement from success. To handle a bully, they become hypersensitive. They are as ill as they need to be to gain the sympathy of a parent who only gives kindness to the sick. In order not to be broken by a suicidal or alcoholic parent, they develop a capacity not feel any of their feelings.\nThese moves are – let’s put it plainly – strategies of near genius. At an age when these children can’t even write their own name or do basic arithmetic, some part of their brain will have worked out how to appease a complicated adult many times their size; some part of them will know they need to be ‘difficult’ in order not to be forgotten, or agree with everything so as not to be murdered.\nWe can applaud such strategies – and yet still recognise that they are the root cause of most of the difficulties we encounter around their grown-up selves. The follies of our partners can be understood in a simple dictum: they are the result of people continuing to do in grown-up environments what it was necessary for them to do to survive their childhoods. They are the result of adaptive strategies enduring in contexts that resolutely don’t call for them. They are the outcome of people continuing to disassociate where emotional presence would be called for, or continuing to be evasive when forthrightness would be key.\nLearning to Thank Our Younger Selves\nTo unwind these strategies, we need – collectively – a non-pejorative awareness of their existence. We need to ask ourselves without shame what the ‘craziest’ elements of our behaviour might be and accept that – almost certainly – these will bear the legacy of some form of early strategy for survival. If we are overly worried about our appearance or our income, if we drink too much or can’t trust anyone, it will almost certainly be because these counterproductive moves were once key to our safety. We need to learn to thank our younger selves for their ingenuity and then try something new.\nThe scene is set for more interesting conversations on dinner dates. We should learn to ask: what ingenious but complex moves did you need to pull off to get through your childhood? And then: how might your strategies from back then be interfering with a successful or calm adult life now?\nObviously, it’s easier to talk about skiing or wine, but we should run if no answers at all are forthcoming. None of us can be entirely sane; the best we can aim for is a knowledge of the structure of our insanities, an understanding of how childhood trauma affects adult relationships, and a willingness to discuss these without shame or defensiveness with a curious and kind interlocutor.\nWe need, above all, to realise that what assured us love in the early years has a very high chance of being the very thing that will doom love for us henceforth.",

Were we to tell them right now – in this pretty restaurant with candlelight, prints of Sicily and the promise of an interesting pear and almond tart later – about the crisis at work, the illness we survived, the sort of sex we’re really interested in, our susceptibility to anxiety, and the amount of time we must spend on work trips and with our families of birth, they will run. The full facts of any life are generally perilous to bear.\nThe Art of Editing\nAnd so we have few options other than to hedge. Some may call it lying; we prefer ‘editing’. We tell them that our first relationship was ‘somewhat stormy…’ We remark that we’ve had ‘a few ups and downs’ professionally. Our father is described as ‘intense’. The situation with our children is ‘not always cheerful…’ Our mood is ‘occasionally melancholic…’ We opt to say nothing at all about our kidneys and our brother-in-law. This also won’t be the moment to bring up the pending lawsuit.\nAs a result of such judicious management, we succeed. There is a second date and a tenth. We travel to the north Norfolk coast, we see the Vermeers in Amsterdam. They meet our friends D. and P.\nBeyond Admiration: The Goal of Love\nBut this isn’t what we’re here for. We’ve come to escape loneliness, not to replicate it in a socialised form. The goal of love isn’t to be admired, but to be known; it isn’t for someone to believe that we are marvellous, but for them to understand us as pitiful and not take fright. We want them to fathom our oddities, our prevarications, the appalling compromises we have made, the shameful things we have done – and for them to forgive us. Anyone can be thought a hero; we want to be known as the shlemiel we are and still be kept in mind.\nIt must – in the end – be a matter of judicious sequencing. People can take a lot, so long as they have first surveyed a basic capacity for decency and good sense. By the two hundred and twentieth evening, they will have sufficient proof that we are also kind, also thoughtful, also (approximately) sane – and so will better be able to withstand the discovery of the sexual kink, our mental fragility and our tormented family bond.\nThey won’t flee when we finally describe the full details of the divorce and the legal challenges in our business, because they have the balancing evidence of our long ministration through their stomach ailment and behaviour around the crisis with their friend in early June. The months will have taught them that we are not merely foolish and thoughtless, not just impatient and very, very odd.\nParents know the lesson well enough. There will come a time to mention what really happened with granny and where the money actually went. But the children will need to be on the far side of twelve, after many quiet readings of The Owl who Loved Its Babies. Honesty in early dating is complex: we must cut the truth into pieces small enough to be metabolised by those we care for. This isn’t deceit; it belongs to the paradoxical, eternally complicated work of love.",

      "text": "News of an engagement has a tendency to privately spark a few raised eyebrows – especially if it isn’t the first time for one or other of the parties.\n\nWhy bother with marriage at this point? Why not just live together? Why take the risk of a costly divorce? Marriage can seem like an oppressive ritual dating from the religious childhood of humankind, not designed for the more logical modern world.\n\nBut the point of marriage is to tie our hands, to frustrate our wills, to put high and costly obstacles in the way of splitting up. \n\nIt is as if we somewhere recognise that there might, rather strangely, be some quite good, though uncomfortable, reasons why making it difficult to split up a union can be an advantage for its members.\n\nThe Marshmallow Test was a celebrated experiment in the history of psychology designed to measure children’s ability to delay gratification – and track the consequences of being able to think long-term. Some three-year-old children were offered a marshmallow, but told they would get two if they held off from eating the first one for five minutes. It turned out a lot of children just couldn’t make it through this period. It was too tempting; the less immediate benefit of gobbling the marshmallow in front of them was stronger than the strategy of waiting. Crucially, it was observed that these children went on to have lives blighted by a lack of impulse control, and fared much worse than the children who were best at subordinating immediate fun for long-term benefit.\n\nRelationships are no different. Here too, many things feel very urgent. Not eating marshmallows, but escaping, finding freedom, running away… We’re angry and want to get out. We’re excited by a new person and want to abandon our present partner at once. And yet as we look around for the exit, every way seems blocked. It would cost a fortune, it would be so embarrassing, it would take an age.\n\nThis isn’t a coincidence. Marriage is a giant inhibitor of impulse set up by our conscience to keep our libidinous, optimistic, desiring self in check. What we are essentially buying into by submitting to its dictates is the insight that we are (as individuals) likely to make very poor choices under the sway of strong short-term impulses. To marry is to recognise that we require structure to insulate us from our urges. It is to lock ourselves up willingly, because we somehow acknowledge the benefits of the long-term.\n\nIt is a very unusual marriage in which the two people don’t spend a notable amount of time fantasising that they weren’t in fact married. But the point of marriage is to make these feelings not matter very much. It is an arrangement that protects us from what we desire and yet know (in our more reasonable moments) we don’t truly need or want.\n\nFor the last fifty years, the burden of intelligent effort has been on attempting to make separation easier. The challenge now lies in another direction: in trying to remind ourselves why immediate flight doesn’t always make sense; in trying to see the point of holding out for the second marshmallow.\n\n"

      "text": "It’s a point that can feel at once entirely banal and wholly offensive. We either know it already or may wince at such an overly direct mention. High-minded people can be especially perturbed and have been since the dialogues of Plato and the sermons of St Paul. True love is about connection at the highest levels: it’s about shared interests, compatible world views, and alignment on politics and the ends of life. We have bodies naturally, and certain urges along with them, but they do not and must not dominate the choices of the wise.\n\nExcept, of course, that - in the clearest terms - they should. For we are never more banal and obtuse than when we refuse to give ‘low’ priorities their due. We eat, we fart, we burp and, to put it very gently, we need to make love. \n\nAnd we need, to succeed at relationships, to do it very winningly (at the level of ideas rather than performance) and rather often. In order to feel close, in order to feel acceptable to ourselves, in order to reconnect with our bodies, in order to feel welcomed by our partner, in order to ease the tensions of having large complex minds that believe they know more than they do.\n\nYet how often, especially in the priorities of the so-called intelligent, this need is either relegated or ignored. There are so many other considerations when we meet someone new: have they read Tolstoy or Cavafy? Would they get on with our sister? Do they like Bob Dylan? Would our friends like them? Are they as tidy or as messy as we are? What do they earn? How tall are they? \n\nWhat can easily get lost is a much more fundamental question: how good is the sex?\n\nAnd here, we need to admit, there are vast variations. Sex is not one thing - though it takes a lot of luck or experience to realise this may be the case. We need, once in our lives, to have enjoyed superlative sex in order to have a benchmark by which to measure its varied instances. There are ecstatic, passable and very forgettable sorts. \n\nThere’s the kind of sex that unfolds when the same fantasies excite us. When the same traumas were sublimated into kinks. When compatible childhood wounds generate erotic currents. When we too want very much to do that thing with the blindfold, the cashmere jumper or the stripey socks. We too want to think about the glances in the restaurant, the caresses under water or the quiet tension in the library stacks. There is either alignment - or there isn’t.\n\nFar more than we can admit, when a couple break up, when expensive lawyers are called, we don’t need to search for explanations in the realm of values and ends. We need to look squarely at the love making. Did it happen often enough? Did two people want it equally? Were they each other’s types? What were the two kinks? And the tragedy is that so often, the problem lay in the very place the couple could not bear to explore, out of a misplaced sense of what could matter. They didn’t want to think about their so-called perverted sides. Neither side wanted to own up to what turned them on in private. They thought they could overcome the shame of their stranger visions by simply being very nice. They believed sex wasn’t - in the end - as important as finding someone who also loved modern art or canoeing. And thereby they destroyed a substantial portion of their lives.\n\nThe more experience we have, the more we’re likely to take seriously what every adolescent knows: sex is very interesting, very strange - and very key.\n\nWe may be clever enough; true intelligence means properly letting our baser, blunter and more compelling urges have their way. \n\n"

      "text": "Let’s imagine you had a bad childhood. You may hardly remember it; it almost doesn&#8217;t matter. The easiest way to assess what once went on is to reflect on how you feel about yourself now. The clearest sign of having had a miserable start is a deep self-hatred. You think you’re ugly. You can’t bear to look in mirrors. You never want to upset anyone and suspect everyone hates you. You feel unacceptable and weird and just – in multiple, non-specific ways – diseased and ‘not right’.\nBehind such feelings, there will have been the usual villains: a critical and unloving mother or father, some violence and unpredictability, a huge preference for a sibling. There are only so many ways these sorts of wounds form.\nBut the real legacy comes in love. Here, after the normal awful adolescence (eating disorders, self-harm, alienation, drink, etc), you have two options.\nThe Two Roads in Love\nFirstly, to fall in love with cruel, distant, possibly violent, intermittent unavailable people. You can fall in love with people who are married to someone else, or who don’t call you, who make you feel inadequate and unseen, constantly alarmed and unsure. You can love people who think you’re unloveable.\nOr else, you can love people who really like you, who think you’re attractive and sweet and clever. And you can feel powerfully ill around them. You can become an expert in identifying what is wrong with them: they’re not clever enough, they’re weird, they’ve got no options. You criticise their taste in shoes, the shape of their mouth, a comment they made at a party. You become as critical of them as your parents were once critical of you. How could someone who liked you be anything other than a loser? You end up pushing them away – maybe not directly, but by going slightly cold or flirting with strangers. You know well enough how to detonate trust conclusively.\n\nEdvard Munch, Two Human Beings (The Lonely Ones), 1896\n\nThis rigmarole can go on for most of your life. Unavailable, cruel people. And sickeningly available ones. And in the in-between times, devastating loneliness.\nA visiting alien would laugh or cry at how silly it sounds. It’s been going on forever; you can be sure this sort of thing went on in Renaissance Florence and Ming dynasty Beijing. They just lacked the language to describe it.\nIs there any way out?\nTowards a Third Option\nThere is – perhaps, just – a third option. To understand what’s going on and to share it with someone who is kind and perceptive (and who might have problems of their own – and a good therapist). To meet someone who threatens to make us feel sick with their sweetness, then to explain to them what we understand of our problem. Rather than pretending that we are healthy and can bear their kindness without difficulty, we may be able to tell them: ‘I want so much to be normal, I want so much to tolerate kindness. But I have an illness. My past means I can’t accept love; I can’t digest it; I turn against it and the person giving it to me. But I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m tired of sabotaging relationships and turning away good people. Please help me to bear the anxiety of being cared for. Please help me to absorb the love I crave. Please forgive me for being ill …’\nIf the person doesn’t immediately run away, if they can see the decency behind the shame and the tenderness behind the neurosis, if they can partly understand our problem from the inside, we will be making momentous progress. We won’t be healed yet, but at least we will know how ill we are – and will have found a way to hint at the scale of our terrors of kindness.",

      "text": "Any exposure to the modern dating world quickly teaches us that there is extraordinary chaos at large, and nowhere is this clearer than in the experience of dating app burnout. The stories are legion. Three amazing dates, a promise of a trip to Vienna or Vancouver, lovemaking all afternoon, then sudden disappearance. A month of texting while they travelled around the US, a few wonderful walks in the park, then a peculiar excuse about a knee operation, followed by silence. A fantastic two weeks, then at dawn, contact from a stranger whispering that the lover is in fact a serial cheat, with screenshots to prove it. A delightful spring or autumn, and then an anguished speech about needing time, not being sure, still having feelings for an ex, or wondering about the nature of existence (aka the metaphysical exit). And so on and so forth.\n\nPhoto by cottonbro studio on Pexels\n\nOne might wish to blame something inherent in human nature. Or a species of bad luck. But the problem is more structural and more comprehensible.\nIt stems from two things: an unfeasible number of options and a lamentable lack of discipline.\nThe Lure of Endless Options\nThe malevolent genius of dating apps lies in providing users with an apparently fathomless array of viable candidates. Any night of the week, we might be out with someone new. And then we can come back and explore six other apparently stand-out figures for the week after.\nThe problem is, very, very few of these options are – in any user’s eyes – actually likely to be optimal. They aren’t appalling, which would at least be clear cut. They are in a perilous middle zone, situated somewhere between ‘OK’ and ‘perhaps’. They don’t exhaust the imagination: they have a dog one doesn’t want, or a child who is a bit annoying, or a missing tooth or a wonky nose; they are a few years too old or young; they don’t live in the right place or make enough money. They aren’t terrible, but nor are they what one has always secretly dreamt of and still believes (somewhere deep down) one can eventually secure with a fair wind.\nWhen Compromise Becomes Self-Deception\nThis is where discipline comes in. Many people in such circumstances abandon the necessary caution. They are lonely, frightened of never finding anyone, they tell themselves they mustn’t be too choosy, the diary is empty – and so they delude themselves that a mediocre prospect might yet fulfil them.\nSo, in a waste of everyone’s time (their own included), they connect with the too short, or old, or young, or poor, or rich, and suggest dinner, intimacy and the prospect of love. The tragedy emerges in cases where the compromise isn’t two-way. One person shows up thrilled; the other arrives forcing themselves to believe this could be bearable. Before anyone quite realises what’s happening, the misaligned couple go to bed, a bond forms, nicknames arise, family stories are shared – all while one of the parties quietly plots a way out.\nMeanwhile, the apps – like a glittering emotional casino – keep luring our imaginations back to the roulette table. Here is another set of candidates to delight in: what about this one who has a boat, or that one who loves brunch or tennis? It’s a new kind of suffering, to have messages from last week’s date (who now calls us ‘sweetheart’) when there might be another three possibly very special people pending in the digital waiting room.\nEscaping Dating App Burnout\nBecause there aren’t any classes on this at secondary school, because people’s brains disintegrate in the face of complexity, disaster ensues. The capacity to behave morally and politely disappears. Rather than explain the ambivalence with courage, they vanish. Rather than resist the urge to sleep with someone, people go home together and then face a gruesome Saturday morning conversation over eggs and avocado.\nThe answers are – in theory at least – simple: never pursue anyone unless you are really quite sure. Never go to bed too early. Wait five or so dates before deepening the bond (it takes that long to know). Never use dating to bolster self-esteem, escape uncomfortable feelings about an ex, or avoid loneliness.\nAs in so many other areas of modern life, our primitive minds are not set up to deal with the abundance – the mediocre abundance – that technology delivers. We eat too many sugary buns, we watch too much porn, we scroll through too much daft news – and we date indiscriminately, then run out of someone’s life mid-conversation.\nThe solution to dating app burnout is standard: understand the issue, have compassion for it, and then – with a lot of bravery and moral fibre – stay home.",

      "text": "We might posit the existence of two very different kinds of single people: what we could call the cheerfully single on the one hand, and the catastrophically single on the other. The contrast raises a central question: how do we live with being single?\n\nThomas Eakins, The Artist&#8217;s Wife and His Setter Dog, c. 1884–1889\n\nThe first kind might last have been in a relationship five years ago, or perhaps six or seven; they aren’t really counting at this stage. They hope they might find someone one day, but if they don’t, they can tolerate their own company, possibly till the very end. They have good friends, they go travelling, they pursue their hobbies. In the evening, they make themselves a nourishing dinner for one and sit on their own in the living room, absorbed in an article about ants or a film from Iran. They are keeping half an eye out for a partner. They are on an app or two. But sometimes a week goes by without them checking, and they’re pretty discerning when they assess candidates. Most people aren’t going to be right for them. They’ll only allow someone into their lives if they’re utterly convinced: the person has to be very attractive to them, kind and on their wavelength. There is simply no point otherwise. Most won’t be, and that’s fine; it’s just the way of the world.\nContrast this with the catastrophically single. They have been in a state of mania ever since they got out of their last relationship on February 10th (or whatever date is engraved on their battered hearts). However old they happen to be, it’s always about to be far too late: they’re on the verge of hitting 30 or 56 or 74 – and then it will all be over. They’ll be relegated to the lowest circle of hell reserved for the lepers of solitude. In their desperation, they put themselves on every available app. They check them every hour – in fact, every minute. They set up date after date, two or three a day on some weekends. They’re not paying attention so much to the quality (a friend could quickly tell them that the candidates were obviously wrong); the key thing is to stay busy at all times.\nWhat Explains the Difference?\nWhat could explain such radical differences? Why are some members of the species one way, and others another? The difference has everything to do with what singlehood means in the eyes of each category.\nFor the cheerfully single, it means nothing more or less than that the right person hasn’t shown up yet – and may never. Crucially, it doesn’t say anything whatsoever about them. It doesn’t indicate that they are awful, corrupt, ugly, stupid, weak or mean. It doesn’t affect their fundamental right to exist, their dignity or their basic goodness. It just means – plain and simple – that the right person isn’t there.\nWhereas for the catastrophically single, aloneness is fraught with the most appalling associations. It’s a reminder of what they deeply know, fear and are in constant flight from: that they are dreadful people. That there is something venal and disgusting about them. That no one wants them. That there’s a hideous truth lurking in them. That everyone is either laughing at or pitying them.\nFrom these two views of themselves, two enormous consequences follow. The cheerfully single will be just that: cheerful and at peace. The catastrophically single will be tormented every hour. In extremis, after too many dates and aborted relationships, they may want to kill themselves, because being alone and unchosen confirms that they don’t have the right to be.\nWhat on earth could explain these two ways of seeing matters? As always, it’s childhood. The way we perceive ourselves now is a legacy of how we were perceived in the early years.\nHow We Live with Being Single\nHow we assess ourselves as single people is a bellwether of our emotional wherewithal. Some of us, the ones who need to be in a relationship right now, were severely neglected as children or overlooked for a sibling. We were never good enough and now hate our own shadows. Whereas the other kind have been given a lifetime of protection, because they appealed very much to the people who put them on the earth. So now, it doesn’t matter if they don’t have a partner (that’s someone else’s loss), if they’ve been on their own a decade, and are eating dinner by themselves again tonight. They’re gorgeous, and they sort of know it (without arrogance or pride).\nThis is privilege, this is luxury, this is what we should all want for ourselves. One of the greatest indications of good parenting is that your child never feels ashamed not to be in a relationship. Ultimately, how we live with being single is one of the clearest tests of whether we were given enough love to endure life’s inevitable stretches of solitude.",

      "text": "We tend to keep a wide intellectual berth between our childhoods and our dating lives. The first was about rubber rings, seaside holidays, sponge cake, Granny, nounou and so on. The second might be about chic West End restaurants, rooftop bars, late-night playful chats on dating apps and trips into the darkness in bold new outfits.\nYet it may be that the two fields are deeply intertwined, and that the clue to the success of the latter lies – fundamentally – in the progress of the former. To understand how to feel worthy of love, we may need to return to childhood.\n\nJohn Singer Sargent, Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose, c. 1885\n\nThere is one question in particular we might ask ourselves around dating that gives us direct access to the emotional structure of our pasts. The question is simply: How lucky do you feel someone would be – in the abstract – to be your partner?\nHere, for some of us, there might be an immediate concern: what if, in answering, we were to commit the sin of arrogance? What if, for a moment, we thought that someone might be very lucky indeed – but thereby got ahead of ourselves? What if we believed we had some value, but were seen to think so by others, and humiliated and mocked as a result?\nWe might become aware of an inner censor, constantly policing our ideas for signs of excessive pride. This censor associates safety and sanity with not thinking ourselves too attractive, with not believing too firmly in our own worth. It has built a bridge between survival and not trusting that we are anything very special at all.\nThe censor may have been active for such a long time, we hardly notice it, just as English people hardly notice the rain. It is simply the background we are used to. We may be melancholy as a result; we aren’t surprised, or even particularly aware.\nReclaiming Our Own Side\nBut imagine if – right now – we were to make this the focus of some serious remedial effort. What if we were to say (quietly in our minds): enough of thinking ill of ourselves. Enough of always giving our opponents the benefit of the doubt. Enough of associating safety with meekness. We might be slightly marvellous. We might be a real asset to someone else’s life. They’d be lucky to have us – very lucky indeed! And if they didn’t want us, too bad for them: absolutely their loss.\nWhat if – first as a thought experiment, and eventually as a reality – we were to come firmly over to our own side, in the way a fiercely loyal mother (the sort we almost certainly didn’t have) might, as she hugs her child to her, strokes their fine locks of hair and calls them her angel?\nWe may be used to mocking mama’s boys or girls – as we mock many things we secretly wish we could have been. But how delightful, and how utterly mature and solid, such people grow up to be. They aren’t the ones suffering from depression; they don’t need to visit psychiatrists; they aren’t bawling their eyes out in the early morning, wondering where they went wrong. They possess all the solidity of those who have, for a very long time, been incubated in love, who can bear themselves because they never forget that they have been the objects of generosity and tenderness from zero to eleven.\nThe Real Inequality: How to Feel Worthy of Love\nLife is roughly the same length for most of us. What is not equal is how cheerful people are with themselves as they journey through it. There is such wide variation, and it is everything. We speak a lot about inequality, and much of politics wants to correct it. But the injustice that really needs fixing is the one between those who possess self-belief and those who do not (because it was stolen from them early on).\nLook at those people eating on their own in the restaurant – feeling utterly content as they ask the waiter for a bit more mustard, because it matters how tasty their meal is. And look at those others, more deprived, more furtive, who walk through the world with a hounded look, who barely dare to ask where the toilet is, who go hungry rather than eat anywhere alone, who could never ask for mustard or gravy or a doctor, who are ashamed of their own reflection and who, because of all this – very sadly – head straight into relationships with people who show them all the contempt they secretly think they deserve.\nWe can fix the problem. But first we need to see it. And to see it, we need to ask ourselves a seemingly dumb sounding question at the putative dating stage. When we are alone, when we contemplate our lives without anyone by our side, we should ask: How lucky would someone be to be with you?\nAnd if our answer is, ‘Not lucky at all, because I’m a piece of shit, I’m horrifically ugly, I don’t deserve to be here’, then the problem isn’t really about us, it’s about those who first saw us and how unwell they were.\nEvery human being is up for differing kinds of interpretation. There is both marvellousness and awfulness in everyone. How we choose to read ourselves is always a choice, not a divinely ordained fact. So, if we view ourselves as wretches, it is only because others – cruel others – chose to read us that way in the distant past.\nThe difference between a flourishing and a self-hating life (and possible suicide) lies in the confidence we have in ourselves. Learning how to feel worthy of love, especially if it was denied to us early on, may be the hardest and most vital work of all. We need to understand what has happened – and take immense care.\nImagine if one day we were to ask: How lucky would someone be to be with you? And the answer came back from inside: Very lucky indeed. That might be the work, and the achievement, of a lifetime.",

      "text": "It’s odd, surely, to use the word ‘courage’ – the thing you need in air raid shelters and cancer wards – in relation to an activity which, in the early balmy days, consists mainly of such outwardly innocuous occurrences as two people meeting up after work to cook dinner in one of their flats, cuddles on the green sofa, brunch on Saturday mornings, hand-holding on canal walks and tender and playful messages that end in ‘xxxx’.\nBut to anyone who has suffered loss, finding the courage to love again is never going to be simple. We may be pleased, of course, that it’s happened. That we matched. That we’ve gone to Liberty’s to buy fabrics together (an innovative second date), that we had a first kiss on the corner of Regent Street and Great Marlborough Street. That they texted us from the Elizabeth line to say they’d love to see us again on Friday. That we can feel how keen they are and know that there could be a real chance here. All of it is rare and thrilling and a delight. All of it is worthy of celebration. In normal circumstances, we would be telling everyone; in normal circumstances, the joy would be unalloyed.\n\nPhoto by focal insight photography on Unsplash\n\nThe Ghost of Relationships Past\nBut these aren’t remotely normal circumstances – and we aren’t remotely normal people. We belong to a distinct category: those who loved and were left. Those who trusted and were betrayed. Those who have spent the previous year in agony. Those who know the contours of hell.\nWe ache for love like everyone else, but we also have detailed knowledge of how it can go. The beginning of every love story unwittingly evokes the start of the last one; we haven’t felt so close to the doomed relationship and its hopeful beginnings in a while. How we matched one Saturday evening, how very quickly we agreed to dinner, how easy it felt in Victoria Park, how shy and yet bold they were in the study, the time they cried tears of joy at having met us and begged us never to abandon them…\nAnd yet we know how it ended, four and a half years later: with the parting on the last day of December, with the absurd half-hearted messages, with deceitfulness and humiliation, with online disappearances and the betrayal at the party in Southwark.\nThe Unknowability of Others\nWe know, too, how despite every wise bit of psychological advice, there simply was no easy way of foretelling the catastrophe. We still can’t quite draw a line between the start – the holiday in Corfu, the visit to their parents, the pizza in Dalston – and what came later. We have had a lot of therapy, we’ve read books, we’ve talked to wise friends – and still we can’t, at heart, understand quite why. Why the curdling, why the change of mind, why the need to lie? We have some cobbled-together theories – their fears of intimacy and traumas around kindness, the role of their mother, the father’s violence, the sister’s competitiveness – but to be honest, in our hearts, in the middle of the night, it still doesn’t make sense. They said they would be around forever, to the very end of old age; they held our hand in theirs, and we believed them. Someone came into our lonely lives, smiled a lot, told us it would be forever, gave us an utterly convincing sense of their devotion and seriousness – and then left.\nFrom this has come a moral: that we can never, ever be totally safe. That we can never know what lies behind a promise. That we can’t tell who we have in our arms.\nThe gurus teach us that we can outwit the dangers by looking out for certain signs; they provide us with checklists of risks. But there aren’t any foolproof methods, any more than a regimen of push-ups and kale will ever allow us to cheat death. Everyone is disturbed, everyone has a troubled past. There are reasons in every backstory why someone might hurt us.\nSomeone can say ‘I love you’ with seemingly thorough sincerity, they can cry on our chest and swear loyalty, they can make up tender nicknames, they can remember our favourite cake – and still, a day or a year or two down the line, drift away and crush us. We have to let go of the safety rail and let ourselves fall without any guarantees.\nFinding the Courage to Love Again\nWhich is why, with the best will, what’s happening now is difficult. Naturally, we’re not taking it in any way for granted that this sweet person has brought over a washbag because they want to stay over at our place more often or gifted us a little jam jar with two tomatoes that they grew in their window box for us. It’s entirely sweet – and at the same time, very, very worrying.\nWe’re also – let’s face it – alone with the worry. There’s only so much that even the nicest, most empathetic new partner can take of the panic that they provoke in us. It isn’t really possible to say, in effect, ‘Be sympathetic for how scared I am by you; be tender towards how much I worry whether or not I can trust you. Be kind about how much you frighten me.’\nAlong the way, acceptance by the new partner makes rejection by the old one seem even more illogical – and therefore painful. If this person can love us properly, why couldn’t the previous one? If we are more than acceptable to the current partner, why wouldn’t we have been so to the prior one? It makes the end seem like a mistake all over again.\nFinally, what if this really were to be our person? If this succeeded, we wouldn’t need to be sad about our ex any more. We’d finally get over them – and that would have a charge of melancholy of its own. Happiness would mean having to say a final goodbye.\nThey mint medals for all sorts of feats. In a better world, there would be one – not huge, not the brightest – for those who have, despite everything, returned to relationships, ploughed forward, picked themselves up, not written too many begging letters (or only a few) – and had the courage to love again.",

      "text": "A Community Dedicated to Learning the Art of Friendship\nWe are inclined to think that the secret of great friendship is all about finding someone with whom we mysteriously and wonderfully ‘click’, without having to do anything about it.\nBut if we want to understand how to be a good friend, this is arguably an unhelpful stance, for it implies that there is nothing any of us can do to become better friends. Friendship is made to look like a mere happy accident.\nAt The School of Life, we think differently. We believe that good friendships follow certain principles, which can be identified, discussed and taught. We firmly believe that we can learn to become better friends – none of us is born knowing how to be.\nHere, then, are some of the principles of being a good friend:\n\nPhoto by Taha Samet Arslan on Pexels\n\n1. Asking the right questions\nWe need to learn the art of teasing out of people the parts of themselves that are sincere, vulnerable and true. Society tends to encourage us to stay on the surface; true friends know how to go deeper. In order to do so, ask questions like:\n—  How did it feel when x or y loss occurred …?\n—  Show empathy: You must have felt quite sad when …\n—  Use self-disclosure to encourage others to remove their masks: I’ve often found myself very scared when …\n2. Sincerity\nAllow space for sadness, regret and melancholy. Don’t come in with aggressively cheerful, leading questions like: ‘Is everything OK then …?’\nKeep enquiries open, allowing room for intimate disclosures.\n3. Silence\nDon’t always speak or interrupt. Allow the other person to unfurl their concerns.\nGoing deep in yourself allows them to go deep in themselves. People can only go as far with others as they have gone within.\nA key part of how to be a good friend is therefore to know yourself as well as possible and use the data about who you are as a guide to who others are likely to be.\nWe all know that, around some people, we feel we are boring and have nothing to say. This is solely a reflection of how many rooms such people have opened in their own minds. The more they have explored, the more interesting their interlocutors will feel in themselves.\n4. Don’t jabber\nIt can be tempting to talk too much about pet themes. Ask yourself, with courage: What could another person possibly do with what I propose to tell them?\n5. Be ruthless\nDo they really need to know this? Can there be a space in someone else’s mind for it – or perhaps not so much?\n6. Allow room for weirdness\nWe’re all stranger than we’re meant to be. Know this of yourself and of others, and clear conversational space that will allow the odder (yet still utterly normal) parts of them to emerge. Remember the dictum: no one is normal.\n7. Know that everyone is anxious and scared\nHowever confident others may seem, they are always likely to be – inside – close to despair, panic or regret. Don’t wait for them to tell you this; assume it is true and respond accordingly, with pre-emptive signs of sympathy and tenderness.\n8. Love in a cold universe\nWe are – probably – the only things in the universe. Out there, it is mostly just gas, rock and silence. So, within our bonds, we must concentrate on conviviality and good humour. It is a very strange and tricky business being human (think of how odd it is to have nostrils or elbows). Let the alienation and fear of ‘out there’ inspire warmth and compassion for ourselves ‘in here’.",

      "text": "When someone is mean to us without good cause – pushes us away cruelly in love, bullies us at work, gossips about our children or steals our money – we are, of course, in pain. But also, to a vexing extent, we are reduced to dire puzzlement. Why on earth did this happen? Why is someone like this? What is wrong with human nature? These questions add a whole new layer of suffering, pointing us towards the reality of generational trauma.\nIt is to assuage such haunting questions that we can turn to a simple-sounding dictum: all cruelty is inherited. The meanness we witness around us in the here and now – in shops, in boardrooms, in bedrooms and in online forums – is always, by a law of psychological economy, something that has been, with appalling diligence, passed down from one person to another. The ugliness that washes up on our doorsteps today is a legacy of ill-treatment, violence, selfishness, hard-heartedness, cynicism and indifference that came – somewhere offstage – from an angry father or a vindictive mother, a rageful great-aunt or a sexually abusive uncle, who themselves inherited corruption from a perverted grandfather or an alcoholic grandmother, all the way up the generations to our earliest ancestors in the Rift Valley or the Garden of Eden.\n\nGustav Klimt, The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze (Detail), 1910–1911\n\nThe Chain of Generational Trauma\nWe can look out across our world and trace these complex chains of inheritance. One child bullies another in the school corridors because someone has been cruel to them back home. One person ignores another’s desperate needs in a relationship because, many years before, their own suffering was neglected by a screaming father (who in turn had been appallingly treated by his father, who now rests in a neglected corner of a far-off churchyard). A friend opts not to step up to help someone because, at a key juncture, their mother remarried, or their father disappeared from their life.\nWe may not be able to know exactly what happened to the person shouting at us in the shop or denigrating us to a colleague. We may never discover the particulars of the fathers who beat them, the mothers who sidelined them, the homes that brought them no comfort, or the nights that ended without consolation. But once we understand the underlying structure, the logic will at least be clear.\nWe can know, from the extent of the fighting, the wars, the alcoholism, the pettiness, that humans have been gifting each other these parcels of hatred for a very long time indeed. He took out his neighbour’s eye because someone took out his leg. She stole their land because someone made off with her heart. They are killing their children because someone butchered their great-grandparents.\nBreaking the Cycle\nWe do not have to confuse such explanations with forgiveness. None of this denies accountability; everyone has the power, and therefore the duty, to stop their inheritances.\nWe can then appreciate, with new strength, what an extraordinary achievement it is whenever someone who has been the recipient of cruelty is able, through imagination and moral discipline, not to hand on the agony to anyone else. When a young man who has been belittled by his caregivers manages to be kind to his children. When a young woman who was taunted by her father does not torment her suitors, and one day becomes a patient and kind-hearted partner to a vulnerable man. We can appreciate anew what true alchemy it is to turn meanness into kindness; to have been the recipient of abuse, and yet to say: this stops with me. To use suffering as a furnace in which to generate love. To end generational trauma is the single greatest opportunity any of us will ever have to change history.",

      "text": "One of the most remarkable ideas in the history of psychoanalysis is to be found in Freud’s 1920 paper ‘Beyond the Pleasure Principle’. Here, the founder of psychoanalysis begins with a prescient observation about human beings: though one would expect them always to try to maximise their pleasure and minimise their pain, they are regularly to be found heading towards situations that repeat, to an uncanny degree, varieties of distress and agony they knew in childhood.\nFor example, a woman whose first decade was marred by the outbursts and rages of an alcoholic father will – without quite noticing what she is doing, and at huge cost to herself – be drawn to a succession of men who drink too much. Or a man who had a sarcastic and withholding mother will – willy-nilly – find himself marrying the very sort of woman who, though different from his parent in outward appearance, mirrors her tone of meanness and neglect.\n\nPhoto by Richard Horne on Unsplash\n\nFreud introduces a crucial term to capture this paradoxical behaviour: in German the Wiederholungszwang, translated into English as ‘the repetition compulsion’.\nWhy We Repeat the Pain\nWhy are we compelled to repeat sufferings in this way? Why can’t we – the victims of poor childhood treatment – make our way towards kindly and nurturing lovers in adulthood? Why do we privilege pain over pleasure?\nFreud’s answer is as nuanced as it is hopeful. It is not, as we might think, that we are simply trying to suffer as we once did, ad infinitum. We aren’t bluntly in love with the pain we were taught to expect. We aren’t heading for distress for its own sake. There is an important (though generally unknown to us) intent behind our apparent folly.\nIn Freud’s eyes, what we are trying to do is repeat an old story with one important caveat: we are seeking to give it a different ending. We aren’t looking to get stuck in endless loops of pain; we’re trying to go back to the source of a difficult dynamic and – with our adult faculties at our disposal, with the full resources that we can now marshal – reach a new and more satisfying conclusion.\nThe daughter of an alcoholic, for example, wants to find someone with an incipient drinking problem, not in order to suffer without end, but to help him stop drinking, explore the roots of his addiction, listen to her reasoning, benefit from her kindness and heal himself under her watch. Similarly, a man wants to find a woman who is as shut off and as cold as his mother, not in order to be ignored until his last days, but to work with this mother-like woman to determine what it was about her childhood that made her like this and gently turn her towards love, reliability and gentleness. Sufferers who are now in command of reason, money, resources, charm and composure, deep down hope that they can heal the very sort of people at whose mercy they once were – and whom, in their childhood hearts, as they wept softly in their little rooms, they had so longed to assist and reform.\nThe Hope Behind the Repetition Compulsion\nIn this picture, what human beings really long for isn’t joy pure and simple (or indeed unceasing grief) but repair, recovery and restitution. We don’t want simple kindness and goodness; we are driven to seek understanding from our enemies and a form of trans-generational atonement from our wrongdoers. Freud might have called it ‘the repair compulsion’.\nThis explains why we are rarely very interested in people who have none of the problems of our early caregivers – however sweet and physically beguiling they might be. We might go on dates with them, but are always likely to register that we can’t find them attractive. We label them nice but ‘a bit boring’, or lovely but somehow, despite ourselves, ‘unsexy’. By which we really mean: not sufficiently afflicted by the psychological issues that we are on a hidden mission to explore and heal.\nFreud didn’t hope that his patients could simply stop being attracted to people who shared painful patterns with their early caregivers. He hoped they would become aware of the unconscious hopes behind their repetition compulsion, and then turn actively towards the challenges of finding different, more satisfying endings. In the Freudian schema, we aren’t conclusively looking to suffer; we are looking to heal the sorts of wounded people who tormented us before we had the capacity to stand up to them – and help them.",

      "text": "There are people who, in most walks of life, are extremely canny and highly able to look after themselves. They may be shrewd in business, undaunted in social encounters, and vociferous in defending their causes in public. And yet, in other situations, these very same people can find themselves sharply and strangely unable to protect their own interests. This is one of the more subtle effects of childhood trauma in adulthood.\n\nPierre-Auguste Renoir, Seascape, 1879\n\nThe situations in which these people become powerless, innocent, unworldly and too pure for their own good are intimate ones. In close relationships, the years seem to fall away from them. They find themselves in a couple and lose any ability to imagine that their partner might be anything other than ‘very nice’ and ‘on their side’. Other people may spot a problem at once; in their eyes, all is completely well until it is far, far too late.\nThey give their partners a huge amount of themselves: tireless in their ministrations, even if the partner is running rings around them. They keep hoping for the best, even when the partner has repeatedly shown themselves to be untrustworthy. They give the other time and money – far more than would be sensible.\nWhy Early Innocence Can Lead to Adult Vulnerability\nWhat is going on? Why can’t this person erect the requisite protective barriers? Generally, it is because their early survival depended on them not fully recognising the unpleasantness of a person close to them; because their childhood forced them into a state of unwarranted innocence.\nThey couldn’t, for example, afford to properly recognise that their mother didn’t want the best for them. They couldn’t bear to think that a close relative might be sexually abusive. It wasn’t in their interest – at the age of five – to fully take on board the awfulness of their father. Psychological survival relied on maintaining a selectively timid, hopeful, naive stance.\nAs a result, the faculties that would normally engage with intimate danger were cauterised and numbed – and have remained so into adulthood. This accounts for the paradox of high competence and strength existing alongside severe passivity and powerlessness.\nRecognising the Effects of Childhood Trauma in Adulthood\nWhen we see such people (and they may be us), we need to extend understanding and compassion. These people aren’t stupid or weak; they have had to learn to switch off their bright minds in particular contexts. They have not been able to be vigilant because vigilance would have meant realising that someone they deeply depended on was a curse – and that was too much to bear, psychologically and practically, when they lacked any option to run away and find new caregivers.\nThe effects of childhood trauma in adulthood can make even the most capable people overlook mistreatment in close relationships. It can take a lifetime to learn a simple-sounding lesson: that we deserve only kindness from those we love.",

It dwells in seemingly ordinary people beneath extremely innocent surfaces. And when we are falling in love with the wrong person, we are particularly blind to its presence. It can exist alongside great intelligence, physical charm, educational certificates, technical mastery and professional competence. We may miss all its cues until it’s far too late to take averting action. And the places where we are most liable to encounter this folly – and to suffer most from its effects – are relationships.\nIt is in the confines of intimate relationships that we tend to come across behaviours that challenge most of our assumptions about sanity. It’s after a few years with someone that we may become acquainted with utter refusals to listen or change, with dramatic absences of integrity or accountability, with advanced failures to communicate and understand feelings, with elaborate inclinations toward deceit and betrayal, with sadism and cruelty – all of which, in their own ways, do merit, at least in colloquial conversation, a term like ‘madness’, or if we’re more professionally inclined, descriptions like ‘borderline’, ‘narcissistic’, ‘dismissive avoidant’, and so on.\nThe Hidden Costs of Falling in Love with the Wrong Person\nThe labels may help for a little while; but it’s sympathy for the wider problem that we really need. We deserve public acknowledgement of – and preparation for – how much psychological trouble we are liable to run into in the course of a so-called ordinary life; how few potential partners there truly are who have emerged from their childhoods with a capacity to act and behave morally and thoughtfully.\nIt is tempting to tie this dark verdict to the gender we’re attracted to. We may say, in despair: all men are crazy. Or all women are mad. One can sympathise with this attempt at demarcation – but the truth is likely to be yet more thorny; psychological disturbance is widespread, regardless of gender. The people we don’t form relationships with may be just as troubled – we simply have less incentive to get to know them well.\nA New Philosophy of Romantic Vigilance\nWe should be worried by how initially normal most people know how to seem. They’ve learnt the codes and the cues. They tell jokes, they are upbeat, they have impressive résumés. It can be years down the line before we’re in any position to realise that they were fundamentally oriented towards emotional starvation; that they could not communicate their reality; that they had no grasp of their inner lives; that they had no stable core; that they could not take responsibility; that they lacked integrity and morality.\nWe may ask ourselves: how might I foresee issues going forward? The truth is that there is no foolproof defence. We need a new philosophy. We should tell ourselves: the great majority of people will be very nice at a public level and for the initial months; they won’t cause active disturbances, they won’t steal or bludgeon anyone to death. They will pay their taxes and show up at work on time. But if we know them from close up, they are at risk – at considerable risk – of acting in appallingly obstructive and dispiriting ways. Falling in love with the wrong person isn’t just bad luck; it’s a reflection of how hard it is to see psychological complexity clearly. This isn’t cynicism or bitterness; it’s a vigilance born of experience. We can trust up to a point, we can have some fun too; but we must never, ever – in love – not be extremely careful.",

      "text": "When we speculate on the causes of mental illness, we typically imagine some form of chemical imbalance or damage to the structure of the brain itself – perhaps a lesion or an abnormally stunted frontal cortex. But the more puzzling news is that, in almost all cases, the brains of sufferers are entirely identical to those of so-called normal people. Mental illness is overwhelmingly not about inherent anatomical damage or chemical disturbance.\n\nVincent van Gogh, Corridor in the Asylum, 1889\n\nWhat it does seem to be about – perhaps surprisingly – is the link between love and mental health, specifically the consequences of a lack of love. If we look at a preponderance of mentally unwell cases, what we find with utter predictability is that these are people who were brought up in conditions of severe emotional deprivation. To put it bluntly: people grow mentally ill because they were not loved.\nWhen someone grandiosely insists that they are the Emperor of China or the King of Kings, one can guess there was been gross neglect in childhood and a feeling of near-total invisibility.\nThe Hidden Roots of Mental Illness\nWhen someone claims they are an alien controlled by extraterrestrial beings, one can guess they were made to feel that they didn’t belong to their own species.\nWhen someone becomes erotically fixated on an unavailable stranger, one can guess they yearned boundlessly for absent caregivers.\nWhen someone disfigures their body and renders themselves conclusively unattractive sexually, one can guess they may have received unwanted attention from an adult early on.\n‘Madness’ is a colloquial term for the set of tragic behaviours people gravitate toward to in order to cope with, and protest against, a world that has felt unfeasibly cruel, mysterious and indifferent. The so-called mad have had to twist themselves to fit into an environment that defied the laws of logic and ethics.\nLove and Mental Health: A Foundation for Sanity\nBy contrast, on the other side of the spectrum, encoded in the behaviours we call ‘love’, we find a range of moves that help people to feel at home on the planet. In a sane upbringing:\n— we’re allowed to feel significant enough that we won’t subsequently need to rigidly insist on our importance.\n— someone will listen to us patiently and thereby enable us to tolerate a full encounter with someone else down the line. We’ll be able to ask questions, sit with our feelings and exercise our curiosity.\n— someone will respect our boundaries and thereby make us unafraid of accepting others into our lives.\n— the warmth of another’s love will prepare us to accept the colder aspects of reality; we’ll be able to bear how things sometimes truly are because – for a time, as we gathered our strength – we were shielded, by kindness, from the full brutality of existence.\n— our caregivers’ words will have been congruent with their actions, so we won’t see plots and conspiracies where they don’t exist.\n— we won’t doubt our worth, because we will have felt good enough to those that mattered.\n— we won’t have to grow up too fast to defend ourselves against the immaturities of adults.\n— we won’t need to fear the punishment of external authorities (the police, the secret services) because we weren’t made to feel guilty for things we never did.\n— we’ll trust that because love was once present, it will eventually come again. Solitude won’t have to entail untenable loneliness.\nWe aren’t – therefore – more sane because we are cleverer or better; we were just very fortunate to have been helped to adjust to reality at a manageable pace, through sustained, attuned care. This is the often-overlooked foundation of love and mental health.\nLove is not a luxury, a kind of game, an add-on, a fruit of privilege or an artist’s fantasy. It is the difference between sanity and madness.",

      "text": "Behind every relationship that endures, we can identify two ingredients.\nFirstly, an ability to break bad news well. Successful lovers know how to communicate in a relationship. They are adept at taking their partners into the trickier parts of their lives with patience and grace – while it’s still early enough, before bitterness sets in, before anyone has grown forlorn or furious. They’ll say, with courage and diplomacy: ‘I’m not sure I like what’s happening in bed…’ Or: ‘I care for you, but I need to spend some time alone this weekend…’\nThey aren’t overly embarrassed by needs that run counter to those of their partner; it doesn’t feel worthy of panic that they don’t particularly enjoy a certain type of music, sport, or way of hugging. They aren’t tempted to stay silent for a long time, only to explode in fury late at night – or to notice that their heart has gone cold when a stranger takes an interest in them.\nTheir natural relationship to their own needs stems from others – probably their parents – having respected and honoured their reality from the first. Even at five or seven and a quarter, they would have witnessed caregivers taking seriously what mattered to them – and they now assume that others can too. From this comes an unpanicked, unashamed ability to spell out who they are, and a conviction – rewarded in spades – that they can be both themselves and a generous partner to someone else.\n\nAnselm Feuerbach, Paolo and Francesca, 1864\n\nNext, and relatedly, successful lovers can take in difficult information. They allow alternative realities to intrude on their cosy assumptions about themselves and their actions. They don’t grow immediately hostile in the face of a challenge. They don’t assume that a partner who suggests they might sometimes be a bit too dominant or bitter, self-pitying or messy, must be lying or unfairly trying to bring them down.\nSuccessful lovers carry just enough faith in themselves not to panic at well-intended criticism. They operate with a background feeling of security: that they can be OK, even if they are occasionally found wanting. They can give ground – and survive. Therefore, they can stand to wonder, with an open mind, whether they might not be, in some areas, a little bit awful – and so ensure they remain fundamentally delightful.\nThe world isn’t short of suggestions for what we might do to improve our lives. But we should prioritise learning how to communicate in a relationship, by putting two ambitions at the centre of our hopes for love: to get ever better at speaking – and at listening.",

      "text": "We won’t get too far in the dating world without stumbling upon the melancholy phenomenon known as ghosting: someone we were briefly close to – and was a source of great comfort and reassurance – will, out of the blue, perhaps after a cosy weekend or an intense few months, refuse to answer our messages, block our access to them across every available channel, and to all intents and purposes, disappear from the planet.\n\nPhoto by 冬城 on Unsplash\n\nTo understand this experience more deeply, we need to consider the psychology of ghosting: what could possibly lead someone to behave this way? It is tempting to respond to the sorrow and confusion that follows with outrage, to say that the ghoster is unkind and rude, cruel and monstrous.\nThey may well be these things too, but it could be just as important to our recovery to try to understand what has driven their behaviour. Why does a person choose to run away so coldly from someone they were once connected to?\nWe can propose that, behind the scenes, the ghoster is operating with three core beliefs:\n1. If I explain, no one will understand\nThe ghoster imagines that others could have no appetite whatsoever for their truth – however it might be expressed. No one would ever care for how they saw things. Were they to try to spell out their side of the story, they would be met with rage and fury. Explanations would only make things worse. They would never successfully be able to say: ‘I’m so sorry, I thought this would be a viable relationship, but I now realise it can’t be – not because I am mean, just because I misunderstood my feelings.’ Such talk would be an open invitation to catastrophe.\nBehind this delusional degree of pessimism about the outcome of speaking up clearly tend to lie childhood experiences of living around singularly terrifying people who couldn’t tolerate any frustration or hurt from their offspring. The ghoster learnt from a young age: ‘You will never be forgiven for anything you do that displeases me. I will try to hit or punish you gravely for every transgression, and therefore (implicitly) don’t even bother to try to confess or atone.’\nThe ghoster’s experiences will have given them an advanced education in the need for deceit and dissimulation. They will have been taught everything about the importance of shiftiness and evasive people-pleasing. They will have learnt to lie manically through the inability of key others to bear their truth.\nThat is why they have now become adults who see no alternative to any mess they have created other than to unkindly pretend they are innocent. They aren’t just being cowardly; they are also – beneath the chaos – uncommonly scared.\n2. I am too repulsed by myself to face up to what I have done\nContrary to popular opinion, the ghoster isn’t remotely relaxed about their actions. They are, as it were, so bothered they can’t be bothered. They don’t for one second think that what they have done is acceptable. Rather, they tend to be so disgusted with themselves to begin with (because of a childhood-derived sense of their unacceptability) that they can’t – paradoxically and unhelpfully – find any way of dealing in a kind way with the unkindness they are responsible for.\nIt takes a healthy degree of self-love to be able to face up to one’s wrongs. One needs to like oneself enough to put one’s hand up and say, ‘It’s true, I’ve been rather unlikeable …’ But if one is already stricken by unceasing self-hatred, there may be little energy to reflect on yet another reason for being undeserving and unworthy. One feels too bad to square up to yet more badness.\nWe may end up hating the ghoster; they hate themselves more than we ever could.\n3. Need is repulsive\nThe ghoster may think of themselves as interested in love; but at a core level, they are also disgusted by the vulnerability and so-called ‘neediness’ it involves.\nThey will long ago have been mocked or harmed for the needs they harboured, and so have now come to despise in others what parental figures despised in them. The way they leave us is a palimpsest of how those they cared for treated – and abandoned – them.\nThey aren’t just running away; they are also punishing their victims for a tenderness they were censured for at the outset.&nbsp; Trauma has turned them into bullies.\n***\nNone of this is remotely to excuse ghosting. It’s to better understand that, however much ghosting may hurt us, by some form of cosmic justice, the ghoster is necessarily already in a great deal of pain. The psychology of ghosting reveals that it takes an uncommon level of suffering to generate someone who hurts others.",

      "text": "It’s a curious fact of our psychology that some of our greatest upsets come from not allowing ourselves to register how upset we are. Beneath states of anxiety and depression, irritability and moodiness, there often lie sufferings we haven’t properly looked at – and therefore haven’t attended to with necessary care – because they don’t fit our ideas of what properly deserves our time and sympathy. We get into serious psychological trouble by minimising the seriousness of our troubles. Much of learning how to process your emotions begins with recognising that even subtle pain deserves attention.\n\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n\nWe know in broad brushstrokes that we should allow pain to resonate. If someone close to us has died, we know we should take time off to weep; if we have been sacked, we know we need to go through feelings of humiliation and bewilderment. And we appreciate that if we fail to do this, our unprocessed pain may show up as insomnia or indigestion, facial tics or lower back pain, rage or numbness.\nThe problem is that the implicit scorecard of pain we operate with – the list of what issues deserve what kind of attention – is riddled with inaccuracies and omissions. We may have good enough entries for the so-called ‘big’ things, like deaths and divorces. But we tend to gravely minimise the impact of a huge number of less well-heralded, less openly respectable kinds of suffering.\nSmall Incidents, Deep Wounds\nFor example, the thought that a short online exchange with a client – which takes a somewhat nasty and sinister turn – might ruin a whole day sounds, at first glance, daft. We’re not the sort of people who’d get upset by this kind of nonsense; we take things like this in our stride. Or what possible harm could come from a short visit to our mother, with whom we have a notoriously poor relationship? Or why would a quick look at an ex’s social media matter? We’re on top of these problems. We’ll be able to get on with our lives untouched.\nExcept we can’t. There has been a blow inside; something has started to bleed. Denying this only compounds the difficulties. We may try to move on, but – as is always the case in psychological life – the unattended sorrow starts to hold us hostage. We can’t sleep. We aren’t able to work. We get uncontrollably angry with another driver.\nThere is no good option but to honour our full sensitivity. In the wake of certain quasi-invisible blows, we need to pause our normal activities and raise a white flag. We need to cry in bed for a little while, call our best friend to complain, or write another entry in our journal. We have to tell ourselves: this hurt, this was awful, and we have every right to wince.\nWe are – whatever we might wish – deeply impacted by a bewildering range of so-called small things. We are – however inconvenient it is – profoundly shaken by the email that still hasn’t arrived, by the off-hand way in which the coffee date ended, by the unfriendly exchange with a neighbour, by the tetchy encounter with a parent.\nHow to Process Your Emotions\nWe should never compound our sufferings by pretending they don’t exist. We should allow ourselves to feel every pain that has befallen us to the full extent that it merits. Learning how to process your emotions means acknowledging sensitivity without excessive bravery and with much imagination, in the name of a life that is more vulnerable, but also far less distorted, kinder and more creative.",

But we aren’t, for that matter, ever being shown the complete picture – for a fundamental reason: they still have a lot to lose. They are our wife or husband, our long-term partner, meant to be with us until death; and therefore, they have a reputation to defend. They rely on our ongoing goodwill and have an incentive to maintain a front.\nHowever, once it’s evident that things really will come to a close – the lawyers are being called in the morning, and the removal van is outside – the bets are off. There is no good name left to defend, the future has vanished, they’re about to become strangers again. Furthermore, there may be fury, a sense of betrayal, grief, pent-up rage, or terror – all ingredients that help one lose command over one’s more diplomatic faculties.\nWhat Endings Reveal\nIt is now, when it no longer matters, that we stand to gain our most telling glimpse of who we have really been with all these years.\nSometimes – even often – the news is highly sobering. For so long, we took them to be touchingly shy and rather modest. In the closing scenes, we discover that what they are most of all is appallingly immature when it comes to expressing their needs, and willing to cause us immense pain in a bid to evade responsibility.\nOr, for so long, we imagined that beneath their steely exterior, they surely had feelings for us. They were well-defended, but not without emotion. And yet, as we discover in the final months, perhaps they truly were without any care. There isn’t a single tear. There are no protests at all. They seem to be plainly and simply glad to see the back of us. Maybe we weren’t hallucinating during the relationship – they just didn’t like us very much.\nTo think that all along, this was hidden below the surface – and that it took an ending to make it clear.\nThe Psychology of Breakups: When We Learn the Most\nBut the news is not always grim. In some cases, we can discover enormous, hope-inducing decency. When they have every chance to exact revenge, they don’t. When they no longer need to be kind, they remain so. Even when it isn’t going to change anything, they work with us to achieve a good ending; they may help us with a health issue or offer us a loan.\nThe index of a person’s real character is how they behave towards those who are no longer of any use to them.\nHence the wisdom of the saying: we should marry the person we would want to be divorced from. Or: we should want to be with the person who it would be a heartwarming surprise no longer to be with.\nWe can learn a lot from being with someone – but, as the psychology of breakups suggests, we may learn even more once the relationship is over.",

It threatens to transform what should be an unconscious mystery into a generic, programmatic manoeuvre. It threatens to rob us of free will – and turn us into marionettes.\nAnd yet, the question of how to make someone fall in love with you need not feel cynical or coercive. It may not violate our integrity to observe that when people do feel drawn to one another, certain factors are – to a remarkable extent – reliably present. If we closely analyse a raft of successful early dinner dates, walks in the park, movie nights and phone calls, we can be almost certain that a few distinct modes of conversation will have been in train.\n\nLudwig Wilhelm Wichmann, Nike Assists the Wounded Warrior, 1853. Photo by Robert Schwarz on Unsplash.\n\nThree elements, in particular, appear to be central to love’s genesis:\n1. Curiosity\nThe leading evidence for, and harbinger of, love is curiosity. To be attracted to someone is, first and foremost, to want to know more. It’s to have a constantly renewed appetite for questions. And not just any questions: ones that aim to unearth why someone is the way they are; what they aspire to, who shaped them and where they might be headed.\nWe feel in the presence of someone properly invested in us when we hear: ‘Why do you think you didn’t stay with them after that?’ or ‘How come the job didn’t, in the end, work out?’ Or ‘What do you believe made it so hard to say anything when …?’ and ‘Where might you want to go next?’\nOf course, the questions must be gently handled. No one wants to face a volley. The curiosity that wins us over must be measured, discreet and unpressured. A lot of the time, we will be unaware that we’re even being asked anything – we will just feel we have a lot to say. Ideally, our interlocutor hovers over what we’ve said and makes remarks that subtly invite us to deepen our reflections. ‘I suppose it must have been difficult to find the energy to leave when …’ or ‘I wonder if it was sad, knowing they’re now with someone who …’ Nothing is being solicited head on, and yet a space is created in which our thoughts can evolve.\nWe might add, the especially important curiosity is the sort that is alive to pain: the kind that is sensitive to what it might have felt like not to have many friends at university, or to have developed a certain illness at a young age. We feel ready to fall in love with someone who signals that what truly interests them isn’t only what is going well; they enquire into our ex who never properly said goodbye; our father who, though objectively loving, was distant and preoccupied; our mother whose affections were mixed with jealousy and a desire for control.\nWhat binds us to others, in a world that constantly requires us to smile, to win, and to face reversals with good cheer, are mutual revelations of grief and isolation. We may well feel aligned with someone who shares our interests and hobbies; we will feel intimately connected to someone who knows about, and can tolerate, our suffering.\nThe central role of curiosity in love tells us something poignant about what is most dispiriting in the rest of life: the constant overlooking of our deeper sorrows, the forgetting of key bits of our identity, the evidence that we barely register in the imaginations of nearly everyone we deal with, and therefore we stand to die as ignored and inconsequential as a minor sun in a distant galaxy.\nMuch energy can be expended on speculating why clients frequently fall in love with their therapists. Is it to do with the way these professionals evoke parental figures? Does their restraint invite seductive challenges? Are they somehow particularly charismatic people? But the answer is, in the end, relatively obvious: therapists are trained to be endemically curious. They continually ask and carefully listen. And so, we may – with no manipulative intent whatsoever – follow them in some of their behaviours: keeping a person’s narrative closely in mind, attending to hesitations and prevarications, and replaying what someone has said using slightly different words to demonstrate our attention: ‘I think what I’m hearing you say is that you never really …’\nOur culture heavily associates the birth of romance with physical gestures: a kiss or an embrace. But genuine romance begins somewhere else, somewhere far less cinematic but far more nourishing: with a sense of being known.\n2. Broad-mindedness\nAt the same time, the great terror of being known is that it will lead to being judged. Which is why the most enticing people – the ones who properly win us over – let us know, subtly, that they have a great deal of room for our weirdness (which, of course, they share in).\nThey don’t need to make a speech on the matter. They don’t have to say ‘I accept transgressions and don’t moralise around flaws …’ By the time any of this has to be spelt out, the game is lost.\nRather, they make their point through indirect revelations: by telling us blithely of some of the less salubrious bits of their own pasts (‘I ate five packs of biscuits in a row and cried all weekend …’) or by commenting on others’ lives in ways that suggest they don’t care for standard definitions of normality or goodness (‘Why would anyone care what he did, so long as no one got hurt …?)\nThe result is a sense that, around this person, we could show a great deal of ourselves without running into censure or prudishness. We could collapse; we could admit we were scared; we could say we couldn’t be bothered or hated x or y – and it would be more than fine.\nAnd so, in their company, we relax – as we perhaps did long ago, when we were small, in the presence of an adult who remembered what it was like to be a child and let us eat unusual foods and talk to them at length about what we really felt about our teachers or our parents.\n3. Kindness\nThe third ingredient is both the most banal-sounding and the most essential. We need to feel in the presence of someone who is kind – because we know, deep down, that we are so much in need of generous interpretation.\nWhy did we fail? Why are we so slow? Why were we so weak-willed? Why don’t we take more care?\nThere are plenty of ostensible reasons, most of them at the top of our minds every new day: because we’re wretched, because we’re not good enough, because we’re ugly and corrupt and banal and should never have been born.\nWe can do this very well on our own. Self-flagellation is our second nature. What we can’t do is come up with the kinder, more liveable answers – the ones that depend on love: because we had a tricky start, because we didn’t have certain lucky breaks, because we would have needed so much more encouragement.\n***\nWe spend a great deal of time hoping our future lovers might be pretty, tall or rich. These are fine qualities, but if we are ever to find a home – one that can shelter us from inner and outer storms – it will be built from curiosity, broad-mindedness and kindness. Small wonder we might respond very well to their first signs.",

      "text": "We may find ourselves in relationships with people we would dearly love to change: people we so hope would drink less or stop sabotaging themselves, move away from their unhelpful friends or take greater responsibility for their health, go to therapy or exercise more. These are the moments when we begin to wonder when to walk away from a relationship.\nWe may deploy every resource of kindness and logic to try to foster these changes: we might make impassioned speeches, seek out specialists, talk them through their issues, drive them to hospital and take care of their bills.\nOur efforts can be moving, but at some point, a difficult realisation may set in: we – the ones who so desperately want our partners to evolve – may actually be the very ones who are preventing them from doing so. It’s our presence, our love, our support, our kindness, our unceasing patience that may – paradoxically – be lending them the very security and reassurance that prompts them to continue just as they are.\nBecause change is so hard, it is rarely undertaken except in response to intense discomfort. It’s only when the agony of doing nothing finally outweighs the difficulty of doing something that one begins to move forward.\n\nVincent van Gogh, Almond blossom, 1890\n\nWhen to Walk Away from a Relationship\nWe may well tell our partners that, unless they change, they will face all kinds of disasters. But by showing up every day, by rescuing them from their multiple foul-ups, we are in fact sending them a very different and far less motivational message: stay just the same and I will still be around, fall and I will catch you; create chaos and I will clean it up. Don’t change, and things will – in a way – be fine enough.\nThe only thing that stands to alter this contract is if, one day, we finally reach our limit. Suddenly, the equation changes. Alone in the apartment, with only the shivering of the fridge for company, with no way to contact us and the laundry piling up in the corner, they may find themselves in enough pain to dare to slowly look at what they had been in flight from for years. One more bit of suffering no longer seems quite so unbearable when they already have to subsist without tenderness or assistance. \nChange Begins in Absence\nAgainst a backdrop of misery, there at last develops a will to confront the drinking, the lack of focus at work, the sentimental evasions around money or the lack of accountability in love. Everything we had fought so long – and so fruitlessly – to bring onto the agenda is facilitated by our absence.\nIn an ultimate irony, these very tricky partners may, in time – if the pain goes on long enough – eventually evolve into highly reliable and thoughtful partners… for someone else. In years to come, it is other, now total strangers who will unknowingly benefit from qualities we did so much to highlight.\nWe don’t have to grow bitter at the irony. We just have to understand – and make our peace with – the peculiar psychology of change. And hope that we ourselves will one day end up with a partner who began in chaos and grew into an accountable, kindly, caring adult because someone else we’ll probably never meet despaired of them enough to leave. Knowing when to walk away from a relationship might be the greatest and most generous catalyst for growth we ever provide.",

      "text": "On the face of it, ‘not liking’ someone during the dating game is everyone’s great prerogative. Who could possibly question our tastes if we complained – on leaving a restaurant or museum – that we found someone too loud or too stupid, too weak or too supernaturally inclined? If we said we didn’t like their chin, or that there was something a bit odd around their hips? Surely, it is up to each of us to decide according to the movements of our own hearts – and, on that basis, to be met with appropriate sympathy for repeatedly failing to find, despite enormous effort, someone worthy of our time and desire.\n\nHenri Matisse, André Derain, 1905\n\nHowever, after we’ve cycled through a certain number of candidates, after we’ve returned home from our 20th or 87th fruitless date, after we’ve once again discovered (aged 42 or 55) that the person across the table from us wasn’t quite right, we may be encouraged to ask ourselves a few pointed questions. These help us to judge whether the problem truly lies with them, or whether it might, delicately put, have something to do with us – reflecting a deeper emotional avoidance in relationships.\nThough many people will undoubtedly be flawed in a panoply of ways, there are cases where the wrongness we detect primarily reflects a psychological dynamic within us – a bias towards rejecting people not because they are unsuitable per se, but because, just out of reach of our day to day consciousness, proximity to anyone (however accomplished and viable they might be) is associated with danger and intrusion.\nWhen Closeness Feels Like a Threat\nThough we may say – in extremely moving tones – that we are highly interested in finding love, it may be that the prospect of actually finding it is not, in fact, at all simple. It may reignite a fear, probably related to disappointments or perverse loyalties formed in childhood, of what could happen if love really did come along. Way back, our attachment to our earliest caregivers may have taught us that loving people is not, in fact, either safe or advisable. We may have learnt, in the vagaries of our family lives, that trusting people was likely to be followed by disappointment. That those who know us from up close are prone to betray us catastrophically. That making ourselves vulnerable will invite abuse. That kindness doesn’t pay. That tenderness is a route to exploitation. Or, alternatively, that to love someone outside the family circle means having to disappoint people who seem unable to survive without us.\nWe may not be aware, as we play the dating game, that we are carrying such complex emotional legacies and double binds. We may sincerely believe that we crave love above all else and would embrace it open-heartedly if ever it came along – and yet a part of us may still, somewhere in the background, be working overtime to ensure that every single new candidate that the apps or our friends have put forward is ruthlessly examined and definitively rejected before they ever come close to threatening our isolation. We may publicly be committed to a relationship while privately wedded to the only state we associate with safety: solitude.\nIs It Them – or Emotional Avoidance in Relationships?\nHow then might we judge the difference? How to know whether we are rejecting people out of a pathological wish to stay alone, born out of childhood wounds – or else rejecting them because they suffer from a maddening conversational tic and have a weird thumb?\nThere is one acute question we might raise with ourselves to tell the difference: if this prospective partner were a bit less keen, a bit less attentive, a bit less enthusiastic about seeing us again – might we like them more? Might distance improve their prospects in our eyes?\nIf the question makes little sense, if we can’t remotely imagine why any of this would make a difference, if there’s nothing at all about them not messaging us for days that would alter the unbudgeable problem with their chin or their laugh, then the problem may, on balance, properly lie with them.\nIf, however, we recognise – pretty much as soon as the question is asked (it may make us smile involuntarily) – that yes, strangely, somehow it does appear that we would like them rather more if they texted less often, that we would make more of an effort if they were busier, that we’d even start to desire and long for them if we didn’t pass muster in their eyes, then what we may be dealing with is not another flawed candidate so much as the activation of a temperamental attachment mechanism formed by our experiences in abusive, untrustworthy, claustrophobic or neglectful childhoods.\nIt is a major achievement when we have understood enough about our pasts to finally cease to feel revulsion or suspicion around those who threaten us with love. When we can take kindness at face value. When we don’t seek to annihilate or punish those who want to be sympathetic towards us. It’s a seismic moment when we can bear to reflect that the real problem may lie not so much with them for liking us, as with our pasts for not allowing us to tolerate another’s curiosity and goodness. This is how we begin to outgrow emotional avoidance in relationships.",

      "text": "It is a measure of how quickly our phones have changed our lives that we are collectively still struggling to understand the powerful role they play in our relationships – and in particular, the special chaos and agony that can emerge from the tangled, falsely innocuous and yet in reality infinitely complicated business of what we too casually know as ‘texting’, especially within the dynamics of an anxious avoidant relationship.\n\nPhoto by mikoto.raw on Pexels\n\nFor most of human history, contact between parted lovers had an elemental simplicity to it. One solemnly took one’s leave at the platform or harbourside in London or Amsterdam, Cape Town or Sydney – and then had no option other than to wait for weeks, possibly months or even years, to hear from the beloved ever again. It made for a deep but also unavoidable and entirely impersonal kind of sorrow. One was forced to miss the other at a rate and rhythm sharply constrained by geography and technology; by the length of time a coach took to negotiate the St Bernard Pass or a schooner to sail the Straits of Gibraltar. Worries were dampened by the implacable nature of the railway timetable or ocean currents. In the meantime, one simply got on with life, collected the harvest or reared the animals – and shed the odd quiet tear at bedtime.\nThe Curse of Constant Contact\nThe situation has been transformed for modern lovers – for better and very much for worse. By offering us constant, seamless contact, our phones have simultaneously opened us up to perpetually renewed opportunities for doubt, disconnection and anguished speculations as to the loyalty and interest of the other person. Exchanges have become live, ceaseless referenda on our worth and value. When divorce lawyers are nowadays called in and assets coldly split up, the true cause is often an irreconcilable, hard-to-mention drama about read receipts and the dance of three blinking dots.\nThe phone has in particular grown into a source of suffering for those pained characters known to psychological theory as the ‘anxiously attached’ on the one hand and the ‘avoidantly attached’ on the other. The former are dominated by a fear that they are never loved enough; the latter live in terror that they are about to lose their autonomy and independence to the demands of an all-engulfing partner. In these fevered anxious-avoidant couplings, one person is forever feeling abandoned; the other, overwhelmed and criticised.\nThe Anxious Avoidant Relationship on Screen\nIn the olden days, such tensions were tempered by technological limits. When there was only the occasional mail coach or carrier pigeon to deal with, an anxiously attached person could take silence at face value – while their avoidantly attached partner had only a single letter or two to write every month.\nBut now the anxious must always wonder, with mounting alarm, why they haven’t, at 18:03, received an answer to the three messages they sent at 17:56. Whereas the avoidant must wonder – with equal sadness and fury – why it can’t be enough to have told their partner they loved them fourteen hours ago and not to have looked at a single notification since then.\nPart of the difficulty lies – as ever – in each party recognising the legitimacy of their pain and their right to make a polite, well-articulated fuss about so-called (but not in fact) ‘small things’.\nTexting as an Emotional Mirror\nIn a better arranged world, lovers would formally be told that the business of texting sat upon a hugely significant area of their relationship. They wouldn’t be left to find out for themselves how much it can hurt to wait for a line overnight or, alternatively, how suffocating it can feel to have to type out a reply under emotional duress. They would be guided to acknowledge their distinctive patterns of communication and articulate them calmly and kindly from the first. Lovers on early dates might find themselves discussing texting styles with the earnestness with which they would otherwise consider plans for children or aspirations around career and money – covering how often they should message; what a comfortable waiting time might be; and how many kisses should fairly appear at the end of a goodbye.\nThere might at the same time be more readiness to explore the ways in which certain genuinely immature and unfinished sides of our personalities can show up in our texting habits. We might admit that there are times when we unfairly try to remedy a sense of emptiness by pressing for ever more contact, or almost will a partner to let us down in their texting habits, so that we can fall back on the peculiar comforts of loneliness and pessimism with which we are most at home. Just as we might, with equal bravery, admit to taking a certain cruel delight in not answering a partner we know desperately depends on us, as a way of sadistically exorcising a dependence on a parent who disappointed us as toddlers.\nAs with so many new technologies, our phones surreptitiously worsen our already existing weaknesses. Like processed sugar for the greedy or porn for the lustful, they play havoc with the minds of the insecurely or defensively attached – and require equal foresight and self-protection. The road to living more easily around our phones begins with a frank acknowledgement of the momentous challenges they present us with. We should be compassionate enough with ourselves to appreciate what an achievement it is to enjoy a calm texting life with a partner – especially within an anxious avoidant relationship – and how much careful work we may still need to do to achieve one.",

      "text": "Impatient people deserve special pity: not only do they have to suffer from their affliction, they also have to put up with the repeated impatience of other people in relation to it. ‘Why on earth can’t you just wait?’ they tend to be agitatedly told at exactly the moment when waiting any longer feels impossible. ‘Relax!’ comes the testy recommendation when worry seems the only way.\nWe collectively treat patience as something we must sharply be reminded to have, rather than a quality we might be compassionately understood for lacking – and perhaps slowly guided towards one day acquiring. But the importance of patience is not merely a moral lesson – it’s a psychological achievement, often rooted in early experience.\nThe Roots of Impatience\nIt’s not really our fault that waiting feels so terrible. All babies are born with marked tendencies towards impatience – or, more plainly put, outright panic. Where in heaven’s name is my milk? What the hell is this pain in my belly? Get this bright light out of my eye! Why am I soaked through in the middle of the night? Early life is bound up with a catastrophic-feeling gap between our desires and the available realities. Disappointment is the most fundamental emotion of babyhood.\nIf we ever recover, it is because someone else came along – someone who was calm, sane and kind – someone to whom patience had been shown a generation previously.\n‘There, there, the milk’s just warming up now …’ ‘It’s going to take two more minutes till we get you into something dry …’ The good-enough parent is on hand with two vital ingredients: reassurance and compassion. The solution will come; it just isn’t there yet. And poor you, how miserable to have to put up with this sort of thing.\n\nMary Cassatt, Mother and Child, c. 1889\n\nA fundamental, unheralded role of a parent is to tide a small person over the gap between their wishes and reality. To say, in effect, again and again: I know how awful it is that matters are not the way you (or I) would want them to be. You are not alone. Your cries are just; all good and wise people are on your side and would wish things to be otherwise.\nIf this sort of containment happened enough times with someone else, later on, we’ll be able to rehearse it for ourselves. Our caregiver may be long dead or have moved on to other things, and yet we’ll still be able to hear their tender internalised voice in our mind. When there’s an ongoing silence from a client, we’ll manage to say, ‘They’re probably on holiday or taken up with another project.’ Or, in darker, more effective ways, remark: ‘What idiots, they’re not worth giving a damn about …’ When yet another relationship has gone awry, the formerly soothed baby will be able to walk away thinking: ‘This may simply need another year or two to sort out …’\nBut many of us were not so lucky. We, the hysterical ones, can’t manage to remember that the front door could get fixed, that someone could come and repair the boiler, that there are ways to get a new set of keys cut, that love or career, money or friendship might work out in a while.\nWe were perhaps overly impressed early on by a parent who transmitted a message that the universe doesn’t provide, that delayed taxis never arrive, that no one is ever going to understand, that screaming is a sensible adult response to sorrow. Impatience, like meanness, is catching.\nThe Importance of Patience as an Adult Skill\nThere is hope, even if we didn’t learn patience early on. We may be able to benefit from remedial classes – which might only require an imaginary friend of the kind an author can be. We’ve got huge advantages over the small children we were. We can find alternatives. We badly wanted milk; we could – for now – have some water. There are Plan Bs, Cs and Ds.\nIn moments of panic, we can internalise a voice transmitted to us across a page. We can remind ourselves of the importance of patience. We can be a parent to ourselves and say: We’ve been here before. We’re still standing. We’re going to make it. We’ve got this.",

      "text": "One of our most powerful longings, in relationships where we have suffered (by which we chiefly mean relationships with our parents and our lovers), is for something we colloquially call ‘closure’. We may not always consciously know why closure is important, but we feel its absence keenly.\nIn the fantasy of closure, long after certain wounds have been inflicted, we imagine being able to sit down with a parent or an ex. It might have been months or decades since the difficult times. We will, in many ways, have moved on. We might be a high-earning executive at an important corporation. We might be in love with a beautiful and kind new partner, with whom we have plans to start a family. Nevertheless, something in us continues to feel responsible for an earlier version of ourselves: a little boy or girl who was roughly handled, who got shouted at repeatedly, who was humiliated and mocked. Or for a loving side of us that had to suffer the indignity of an affair, that had to watch their then-beloved partner slide away evasively and mysteriously, that wrote a succession of long letters that went unanswered.\nWhy Closure Is Important – and Why It So Often Eludes Us\nThat’s why we have called for a meeting with a now elderly parent who arrives with a walking stick – or for a tea with our ex who greets us warmly in a new bright-blue outfit. The fantasy might go something like this: ‘I felt from the first moment as if you favourited my sister; nothing I did was right. Why were there two rules in our family? One for me, and one for her …’\nAnd the parent, who has thought about this at depth, who has spent hours reflecting on their role, who has ached to make amends, will say: ‘Darling, I know how much this has hurt you. I’ve tried so hard in recent years to make it up to you. I know you resent me fiercely still. What matters is to say how much I love you and how sorry I am for the pain this caused you …’ They might go on to give a backstory to their cruelty. They behaved like this because of their relationship with their own mother. They know why they were imperfect. They’re accountable. They understand themselves. They’re extremely sad about it all.\n\nPhoto by Annie Spratt on Unsplash\n\nLikewise, the dream is that the ex-partner will have shown up with a raft of insights. They will have gone to therapy and benefited. They’ll have used the months since the parting to put together the pieces: ‘I didn’t dare to explain that I wanted a new start. I felt grateful to you but also so guilty. It’s from this that the affair came. It’s not excusable – you’ve every right to be furious with me …’\nBut though such poignant moments must exist – though there have, in the history of the planet, undoubtedly been such scenes by pyramids and waterfalls, in temple gardens and colonnaded arcades – we can confidently, quietly insist that they have always been the exceptions.\nFar more common is ongoing dislocation and mystery: the parent who flares up, &#8216;How do you mean? Why can’t you be more grateful? Yet more moaning, I suppose.&#8217; Or the lover who denies everything or vanishes into a sentimental fog: &#8216;I’m sorry, I can’t think very clearly. I’m sure you’re right. I must be going …&#8217;\nWe can come away with a dictum: if they were damaged enough to hurt us as they did, they won’t have the wherewithal to heal us as we hope. No one who could crush a five-year-old child or rebuff a caring partner will plausibly be able to turn around in years or decades and make it right. One either has the capacity for kindness and maturity – or one doesn’t. One either has tendencies to sadism – or one doesn’t.\nThis is not to say that we should stop seeking closure; only that we should stop seeking it from the very people who made it necessary.\nFinding Healing in Unexpected Places\nWe need to take our longings to other, more effective figures: to wise therapists, to kind friends, to new partners, to substitute parents. These will be the ones who will explain, who will set pain in context, who will replenish our reserves of hope. In learning why closure is important, we also begin to understand that its source is rarely those who wounded us. There are people who can right our wrongs; they are just very seldom the confused, unformed people who actually wronged us.",

Or what about a special time near…? We long to create memories, isolate beauty, enjoy our senses: a fish place by the river, an Italian hilltop town, a Belgian art gallery. We invite restaurant owners, shopkeepers and museum curators to delight us. Half the commerce of the world is about decorating the early days with joy – blissful moments that may one day deepen the pain after a breakup.\n\nPhoto by Tim Collins on Unsplash\n\nThe Hidden Cost of Beautiful Beginnings\nBut if we are experienced at love, we know a darker truth. If love were ever to go wrong, these would be the centres of agony.\nWhen a relationship collapses, it isn’t the painful bits that we ever focus on. We don’t lament that we argued. We don’t cry that there was a hideous scene of jealousy outside the museum. We aren’t furious that they constantly misunderstood our relationship to our brother. All of this has been paid for already. It’s old news.\nWhat surges forward is something unexpected: the beautiful bits. The trip to the hills. The hotel room in Rio. The jacket we found for them in the little shop by the winding alleyway in Seville. The funfair in Helsinki.\nWe thought all these things had been laid to rest, that their recollection served no further function. But some nostalgic demon inside us insists on going to explore each one in ghastly detail.\nAnd so, a wariness may befall us as a new relationship builds: by all means, let’s do the lovely things. Let’s not avoid the picnic in the park. Let’s book the holiday to the islands. But there is also a suspicion and a fear: a Greek island, again …? Another trip to a gallery? Dare we really risk doing this? Dare we stop the car and suggest a swim in a lake, take a picnic blanket and go and buy cheese and bread from a farmer? Can we truly bear the cost if things were to go wrong, if they were to cool, if six months or years from now, they said they needed some space or wanted to pursue a job in another country?\nUnderstanding the Pain After a Breakup\nThere is no pleasure that isn’t an emotional catastrophe in waiting. There is no delightful moment that we won’t know how much we’ll have to suffer for until the end. The pain after a breakup is always rooted in joy. Call no lover happy till they die.",

      "text": "It is tear-inducing just how much can go wrong in love because we have failed to master a basic-sounding yet hugely important skill – one that would probably have been in place if our childhoods had given us the right experience: the art of saying how we feel, relatively close to when we actually feel it, in a way that can be heard, with gentleness and self-possession, before our affections are irreparably affected. This, in essence, is how to express your needs in a relationship: not with drama or accusation, but with sincerity and care.\nThe Risks of Being Too Accommodating\nImagine that we have been single for a long time. There have been many months, perhaps years, in which we wondered whether we deserved to be with someone, doubted our qualities and feared that love might never return.\nThen, unexpectedly, someone comes into our lives who seems a delightful prospect. They look nice, they can talk properly, they are interested in us, and we had tender chats.\nThen slowly, they begin to mention that they love sailing and that they share a small boat with friends out on the lake. Their excitement at being on the water is palpable. They are so keen for us to join them and enjoy their hobby. They mention an ex who wasn’t so enthusiastic – and what a pity that had been for them as a couple. The stakes feel high. So we go – of course we do – and we try very hard to be a good sailor. We compliment them on the (surprisingly tiny) boat, we admire the views, we help with the sails, we do our best with the stove. And then, after the third sleepless night, uncomfortable and exhausted, we can’t take it any longer. There’s a side of us that wants to scream at them for not noticing how ill at ease we feel, that hates them for their self-centred hobby and wants to swim to shore and never contact them again.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Stenholm on Unsplash\n\nThere are identical versions of this moment in other domains: the other loves long country walks. Or playing the guitar. Or talking about Hindu poetry. They garden constantly. Or they have a particular thing they like to do in bed which is painful and frightening.\nLearning the Language of Our Needs\nIn a better-arranged world, we would have been trained for such moments from an early age. Alongside lessons in physics and geography, we would have learnt – in our Emotional Communication classes – how to speak about our most intimate needs without causing upset.\nThe teacher would have told us to begin with a fundamental conviction: our needs are legitimate. There isn’t anything wrong with us for not liking sailing or not wanting to go on exhausting country walks or not being thrilled by horses or being scared of old churches. These aren’t problematic positions – they are just us.\nAt the same time, it isn’t fair or kind to say nothing at all and then, when we are at the end of our tether, to start shouting our needs, acting out our rage and blaming them for not being able to read our mind, when we have never taken care to open up to them.\nIt is incumbent on them to listen, of course, but it is equally incumbent on us to speak. We have to find our way to a poised manner of imparting difficult messages. In this ideal school, there would be competitions testing us playfully on how to handle the most difficult messages in the most effective ways. There would be prizes for the victors and a marshalling of the best competitive spirit.\nExample questions might include:\n– You are frightened by their religious convictions. What do you say?\n– You are uncomfortable with how close they are to their sister. What do you say?\n– They think you adore their cooking, and you don’t really. What do you say?\nTo prepare, there would be modules on the constituents of successfully phrased complaints:\n\nStart with reassurance: ‘I love you a lot, there’s just this thing…’ ‘Please know that I’m only speaking because of how much I care about you, and about us…’ ‘My respect for you is boundless. I wouldn’t be here otherwise, it’s just there is this thing…’\nState your position with a calm conviction in your right to speak: ‘There’s an issue I have about sleep…’ ‘For me, poetry has always been a matter of…’ ‘I know most people don’t see eye to eye with me on this, but…’\nGive them room to disagree. They don’t have to adopt your position – only acknowledge the differences with grace. You aren’t looking for perfect alignment, just a good enough understanding. ‘It’s fine that we might not be on the same page…’ ‘I know you can’t agree with me on this, but hopefully…’\nAnd if, even after this, things don’t go well – if they become furious or start to blame you – then you have done yourself an enormous favour. You’ve caught the problem early, and now – with sadness, but also haste – you must remove yourself from the situation and look elsewhere. Someone who has no space for your politely worded complaints cannot, whatever other qualities they may have, be a person for you. How to Express Your Needs in a Relationship‘It’s been a pleasure getting to know you to this point, but I don’t think we’d be doing either of us a favour if…’\n\nHow to Express Your Needs in a Relationship\nIdeally, we would have learnt all this at school. But it would, of course, be even better if the groundwork had been laid down at home. If, when our needs emerged, a parent was on hand to model for us how to say how we felt without causing discord on the one hand or abandoning ourselves on the other. It would help immensely if a parent had said, the first time we needed to go to the bathroom but felt an inhibition about asking: ‘You must always simply tell Mrs Jenson that you want to go. Put your hand up politely and they will understand.’ Or: ‘Just tell Sophie’s mother that you don’t like chocolate cake and you’ll be happy enough with something simple like bread and butter.’ And if this parent could also have lent us the sense that if someone has no room for our politely phrased complaint, then we have every right not to blame ourselves: ‘Well, that teacher doesn’t sound very kind, it’s not decent to behave like that…’\nThis matters because too many relationships falter on the basis that someone has lost their tongue. There is a limit to how long we can suffer in silence before love goes cold. We can’t keep having sex that makes us uncomfortable before we go off it entirely. We can’t keep sailing until we despise them for making us tired and sunburnt. We need to catch the problems while there is still goodwill.\nIt can seem that the enemy of love is being ‘difficult’. That, in order to be a good partner, we shouldn&#8217;t introduce too many discordant needs. But with time, we come to realise that the real enemy is not knowing how to express your needs in a relationship. We are allowed to be as complicated as we are – so long as we can explain how the world looks through our eyes. We don’t have to have ‘normal’ sleeping patterns, or ‘normal’ tastes in sex, or ‘normal’ views about animals. What we need is the skill of taking another person into our world so they can understand that we are at once good people and different people. We need a profound conviction that it is entirely possible to be ourselves and to be loved, so long as we have spoken gently. And that we won’t accept anything less – from them, or from ourselves.",

      "text": "We are, most of us, familiar with a particular kind of challenging human: the sort who seems unable to listen to much of what we might have to say to them. Their behaviour can be exasperating – yet it invites a deeper curiosity, one that touches on the psychology of not listening.\nWe mention we recently went on holiday to Greece … Really, they say, well they went there last year and there was a small hotel, and their friend said that … We explain that we suffered a flood in our house. What a pity, they reply, because here’s something about plumbing and the state of boilers in older properties. We note we have a colleague from Finland in our office. Well, during the Second World War, there was a battle near Helsinki where … There is nothing we might share – however urgent or sincere –that won’t very quickly be subsumed into one of their pre-existing, disconnected imperatives.\n\nPhoto by Logan Gutierrez on Unsplash\n\nThe Psychology of Not Listening\nWe’re used to considering such cases as stemming from a lack of manners. The person who talks relentlessly about themselves and their themes must – first and foremost – be rude. They haven’t been educated to consider others’ feelings. They have forgotten the laws of etiquette. They’re the equivalent, in the conversational domain, of a ruffian who wipes their mouth on the back of their hand or never writes thank-you letters.\nBut what appears as a lack of consideration may, in reality, stem from something far deeper and more psychological. We’re not dealing with an omission so much as a compulsion, not an excess but a deprivation. The person hasn’t just forgotten to listen; they’re unable to do so.\nAnd the reason is poignant: fear. The non-listener registers an acute sense of danger whenever they are called upon – in company – to attune to another’s reality, as though there was a stark choice: either them or us. They vaunt themselves, circle their pet themes and chatter endlessly to fight off a terror of annihilation. It isn’t egoism or over-confidence, but an extreme feeling of fragility and invisibility. The non-listener must shut others out in order to keep themselves alive. If they were to park their concerns for even a few moments (to ask us about our work, or our sore elbow), they might feel there would be nothing left of them when they returned.\nThe Roots of Generosity\nInevitably, there will be a sad backstory. They cannot listen because – for a long time, in the early years – they were not the focus of anyone else’s interest or delight. No one was especially charmed by their drawings; no one remembered their smaller sorrows and pains. It wasn’t amazing to anyone else that they existed. They have grown into the over-zealous guardians of a sense of specialness that they should have received from others from the start.\nTheir behaviour only serves to evoke what an achievement it is to be able, at times, to be the one who asks the questions and takes the back seat. If we can do this sincerely, it will be because someone, somewhere in our past, dropped to our level and tried to imagine the world through our eyes. Amidst their own cares and chores, someone gave us room. We came to them with a drawing (of a buttercup and a giant spider) and they asked us for the origins of our inspiration. They listened carefully when we told them of our plans for an underwater world or our fantasy of a wand that could turn furniture into chocolate. It was such early generosity that now makes it tolerable for us to immerse ourselves in the twists and turns of another’s breakup or a second cousin’s house move. We aren’t so much polite as fortunate.\nNone of this removes the problem, but it may just give us something a little more interesting to consider the next time we are bored into a claustrophobic stupor by one of our fragile, kind, wounded non-listening acquaintances: a chance to reflect, with compassion, on the psychology of not listening, and on what early absences might have made such behaviour feel like a necessity.",

      "text": "‘The Big Rock’ is an etching completed by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya in Madrid in 1810. It is - ostensibly - a representation of the world as we know it. It shows us some buildings, trees, animals, clouds.\n\nAnd yet, the more we look at the image, the stranger it becomes. Nothing is, on closer inspection, exactly as it should be. The two trees in the foreground are growing at a highly peculiar diagonal, blown by some unholy wind sweeping in across the valley. There’s a giant rock pointing in exactly the opposite direction, shaped like no rock we’ve ever seen before, threatening to topple over murderously. It’s as if nature has come unglued, and nothing, not even gravity, can be trusted. In the distance is what could be a monastery, a boarding school or a prison: an institution we wouldn’t want to be in, where guards are pacing, and inmates are keeping a threatening eye on the scene through barred windows. It speaks of all the places in society where order and care should reign - but which in reality typically hide discipline, cruelty, or abandonment. A building of reason and purpose, framed in a landscape of delirium. Then at the bottom left is what might be a long-necked donkey, passive, docile, resigned, used to the ways of its masters, perhaps about to lose its life to the crush of that uncanny rock. It is heartbreakingly unaware, it may be us, supinely facing doom, disassociated, keeping on with our grazing while the ground cracks open.\n\nIt’s a world gone silently entirely crazy, pretending to be sane while wholly unmoored. We might be walking through a particularly intense quiet nightmare, a moment of lucid psychosis.\n\nWe can feel grateful to Goya for going deep into our troubles - and his - to bring such an image into the daylight. He’s gone far into the underworld; an occult place away from the realm of our usual logic and facile sense of coherence. This is a world of perverse illogicality, in which we nevertheless all have a home.\n\nWe’re being invited, for a time, to recognise our collective folly: we, the animals, the institutions, our partners, our families, our ways of life. None of it makes sense in the way we tell ourselves insistently on bright mornings. Goya is not going to add to the sentimental hogwash. There’s latent threat and cruelty everywhere and this great man (he was by this stage deaf and afflicted by what we’d call manic depression) can bear to see it. We’re only pretending to be in control. The world isn’t right, the sanest among us know it and the kindest among us can bear to tell one another and commune around the pain. Here is an artist for when we are too sad, wild and exhausted to continue to pretend that everything makes sense, when we finally have an appetite for the true mystery and pain of being alive.\n\n"

      "text": "At the core of heartbreak lies a particularly cruel belief: the belief in our departed lover’s profound uniqueness. In the wake of our abandonment, we are visited by the certainty that our companion can and never will be replicated. It was precisely their way of tucking in their sleeves, of leaning forward in a restaurant, of navigating a train station, of closing their eyes in a kiss that made them who they were. And therefore, our grief can – despite the many inconveniences – fairly have no bounds. It is one of the defining emotional tasks of healing after a breakup to confront this belief and slowly, patiently, dismantle it.\n\nEdvard Munch, The Kiss, 1897\n\nWhen hearing our laments, well-meaning friends may – with great kindness – begin to point out what appears, from the outside, to be an almost obvious truth: that there are eight billion people on the planet and that the departed lover cannot, therefore, be fundamentally irreplaceable. That we must be exaggerating the difference between one person and another. That we must be guilty of turning a standard human into an irreplaceable deity.\nYet such kindly arguments hold no more force than a parent’s insistence to a young child that their favourite teddy, Nonou, forgotten in the crack between seats on a transatlantic flight, can be lightly replaced with a visit to a toyshop. Whatever the fine reasoning, we return to our sodden pillow with renewed sorrow.\nWhat We Truly Loved\nTo rescue ourselves, it may eventually be necessary to take on that driest of disciplines: philosophy – and in particular, the branch of it that considers the foundations of personal identity. We should dare to ask ourselves a peculiar-sounding question: what was it that we loved in our departed lover? At first, the enquiry may make little sense. We didn’t love anything as such – we just loved them: Roisin or Mateo, Keiko or Rajesh, Ximena or Yusuf, Layla and Santiago … There weren’t any reasons, there was only specialness, and now there is pain.\nBut we should stick at the question and, through our tears, try to tabulate certain ideas in response. What begins to emerge is that – in truth – our affection can’t ultimately have been just about their existence. It must have focused on certain qualities we perceived in them. When we reflect closely on why we loved them as we did, it was because of qualities: Roison’s tenderness, Mateo’s playfulness, Keiko’s sense of irony. &nbsp;In other words, though it seemed as if we loved a person purely and simply for themselves, what we really loved were a raft of qualities they harboured: their way of listening without judgment, their ability to find humour in mundane moments, their persistence in the face of obstacles, their curiosity about strangers&#8217; stories, their talent for finding beauty in ordinary places.\nHealing After a Breakup With a Qualities-Based Understanding of Love\nPhilosophy invites us to move from a person-based understanding of love to a qualities-based one; to shift from thinking that what made someone lovable was that they were Valentina or Kenji, Noor or Kwabena, to recognising that we loved them because they had a strong feeling of fairness or a dark sense of humour, an ease around children or a sensitivity to poetry\nWe might think this an arcane and incidental distinction – hardly worth the effort of making it. But it opens up an avenue for eventual recovery. For unlike a love of personhood, which is necessarily a&nbsp; singular phenomenon, a love of qualities of character exists free of any specific individual. Qualities, by their nature, are transpersonal – they are found across the species. They are the birthright of all humanity. Our lover borrowed them, made a temporary space for them, but they could not have created them or claimed a monopoly on them. They do not own justice or poetry; they do not have an eternal claim on humour or tolerance.\nIt can be a particular worry that, by starting up a new relationship, we will end up being disloyal to our ex. But according to this thesis, we can be properly loyal to a person we adored not by continuing to love them (when they no longer want us), but by continuing to love what we loved in them, in new people. We can shift our loyalty from the person’s name to the loveable qualities beneath their name – which we can search for and honour in a variety of alternative candidates, thereby preserving the basis of our affection despite the unwanted departure. By understanding more clearly why we loved them, we can loosen our obsessive focus on them. Our ex becomes less uniquely adorable once we become clearer about what we adored about being with them. We are not – by moving on from them – being asked to abandon what we loved. We’re being encouraged to locate those cherished traits in new domains.\nWhen we say we miss them, it is, in the end, something narrower we are nostalgic for: good qualities. It is tenderness, worldliness, conviviality or open-mindedness we loved – first and foremost – not, inherently, the bodily envelope in which these qualities came to rest. We encountered these things in them and with them, and so it’s natural to assume, at first, that losing the person means losing everything linked to them. It’s true that we’ll never meet another person exactly like the lover again. They are unique. But the good things we met in and through them are general. They exist elsewhere – not all bundled up in one person in quite the same way, but distributed more widely across the human race.\nOther versions of such smiles exist. Other versions of their sophisticated, slightly cynical take on life. Other capacities to make ambitious weekend plans or laugh at pomposity. In losing one person, we can’t logically have forever lost contact with the elements that made them valuable – elements that continue to exist, scattered throughout humanity, waiting for our curiosity and courage to re-emerge. Healing after a breakup involves this exact kind of shift: from the irreplaceable to the universal. We may have lost a person, but we haven’t lost – and don’t ever need to lose – what made them precious.",

      "text": "‘Cures for Love’ is the title of a self-help book written by the Roman poet Ovid in 2 AD that offers consolation and companionship to those who have suffered abandonment in love. In its pages, we find one of the earliest meditations on how to mend a broken heart. Forty-five years old at the time of writing and already on his third marriage, Ovid had extensive personal experience of heartbreak, and knew too of its often tragic impact on friends and acquaintances. ‘Why should any lover hang from a high beam, a sad weight, with a knotted rope round his neck?’ he rued.\nAs a keen reader of legend and history, Ovid was also versed in the role of heartbreak in multiple appalling mythological tragedies: it was heartbreak that led Dido, Queen of Carthage, to take her own life; that drove Medea to kill her children; that caused Circe to lose her mind; and that inspired the Thracian princess Phyllis to hang herself after her lover Demophon left her to return to his native Athens. This was no light or laughing matter. The end of love might kill.\n\nAeneas and Dido, from a Roman fresco from the House of Citharist, Pompeii, Italy, c. 10BCE–45CE\n\nOvid’s Advice on How To Get Over a Breakup\nRead today, Cures for Love (Remedia Amoris in the original) speaks to us in the tone of a wise, occasionally stern, always concerned and kindly doctor. Ovid’s advice ranges across the field:\n— Have lots to do: ‘If you take away idleness, Cupid’s bow is unstrung… be busy, you’ll be safe’. Appease your yearning by going on a trip, entering politics or starting a business.\n— Stop idealising the departed lover: ‘Tell yourself often what your wicked girl has done and keep every hurt she inflicted before your eyes.’\n— Make an inventory of all the lover’s physical and psychological flaws and rehearse these every day: ‘I want you to become fluent in them!’\n— Don’t beg or lose your dignity in front of your ex: ‘Though, unhappy man, you may be roasting in the midst of Etna, make it seem to your girl that you’re chillier than ice… She’ll soon drop her disdain when she sees your indifference.’\n— Never go back to someone who has rejected you: ‘The door is wide open? Though you’re called to, pass by.’\n— Be careful of any communication: ‘If you love but don’t wish to, avoid making contact.’\n— Cut yourself off from the lover’s friends and family. Every reminder worsens the illness: ‘For you to reach dry land, it’s not enough for you to leave the girl. Say goodbye to her mother, sister and the nurse who’s in the know.’\n— Beware of memories: ‘Rereading letters shakes a steadfast heart.’\n— Delete photos: ‘Remove the wax images of her.’\n— Stay away from music and theatre. Avoid poetry too: ‘Disloyally I banish even my own gifts.’\n— Either drink so much you forget your grief – or drink nothing at all so you remember your wisdom: ‘if it’s anywhere between the two it’s bound to do you harm.’\n— Have a lot of new relationships: ‘Vast rivers are thinned out through many channels; fierce flames die down when the fuel’s removed.’ (In case we want to inscribe this on the wall in the original: Grandia per multos tenuantur flumina rivos / Saevaque diducto stipite flamma perit). ‘Let her be just one of many to you now.’\n— Spend time in the countryside. Get involved in gardening. Raise sheep. Cultivate vines.\n— Surround yourself with friends; avoid too much solitude: ‘Fear seclusion, men who’ve been hurt by women, women by men.’\n— Don’t get embittered or cross with exes: ‘That conclusion suits uncivilised natures.’\n— Don’t get petty about belongings and presents: ‘Tell her to keep the gifts you gave her.’\n— Forgive Cupid; he doesn’t know what he’s doing.\n— Expect it to take far, far longer than you wish: ‘Put faith more in love being extinguished slowly than suddenly.’\nDignity in Shared Suffering\nThe advice is consistently solid and applicable. But its true power arguably lies less in any particular recommendation than in the idea that someone, over two thousand years ago, understood exactly – with a freshness that might have us checking dates in disbelief – what now feels utterly agonising in its novelty and individuality.\nWe, who are mired in the specifics of our story, can raise our eyes and situate ourselves more accurately – and redemptively – in a boundless, timeless landscape of loss. None of this began when they started pulling away after the holidays or before their friend’s leaving party; it has been going on since the time of Homer and Augustus, since Romulus abandoned Remus and Mark Antony forsook his duties for Cleopatra. Long before the Crusades, the Beatles, the Battle of Lepanto or the construction of Chartres Cathedral, there were men and women shattering one another’s faith in everything by smiling wanly and asking for a bit more space. This disaster has been unfolding for a very, very long time. It is no personal flaw, no reflection of a modern, technologically-inspired malaise. The affliction is encoded in our humanity.\nBut the ancientness dignifies the relentless crying we did in the bathroom last weekend. We aren’t just weak. We stand in a line of mighty lovers who have been felled by their partner’s changes of mind. We’re going through what the Queen of Carthage endured; we’re suffering as Thracian royalty did. We are partaking in one of the oldest, grandest forms of sorrow.\nIt may help that Ovid’s advice is expressed in an antique tongue we’re unlikely to understand. When he writes successore novo vincitur omnis amor (‘every love is defeated by a fresh successor’),&nbsp; it matters less what’s being said than that it’s being said in a Latin once spoken from the shores of Britannia to the banks of the Euphrates –in the language of those who built the Colosseum and the Pantheon, fought in the battles of Actium and Cannae, made goblets now held in the museum of the Vatican, and wrote down inventories of olive oil in the markets of Hispania. It is a cadenced, alien language that draws a line across time from the Roman Forum to the desk where you now sit, scrolling through your phone, pretending to work, eating too many biscuits, looking out at the trees, wondering where it all went wrong.\nIt’s not pretentious to delight when Ovid keeps referring to strange historical and mythological characters – when he tells us that ‘Callirhoe made Alcmaeon share her bed, lest he always love Alphesiboea.’ Or that Orestes’s pain after killing Clytemnestra was soothed by the friendship of the loyal Pylades. The allusions help relativise our mess. We, who’ve been ripped open by our perfidious sweetheart, who were going to go skiing with them next winter and start work on the garden together, can now make some unexpected suffering friends from foreign lands and eras. It hurts like hell; but at least it’s not – on top of everything else – in any way new.\nHow to Mend a Broken Heart\nWe need so much reassurance. We are terrified. The pain doesn’t seem to end. We so badly want someone to have walked this path before, and to tell us that there will be some kind of bearable conclusion. Ovid is sure there will be. He finishes his book by telling Cupid that he knows how to outwit him – and by reminding Dido that if only she had been able to take his advice, she’d still be alive.\nOur little wretch from Instagram – who gashed our heart and destroyed our peace – may presently be partying without remorse in Brooklyn or Lima, Melbourne or Jakarta. We may be horribly alone with our betrayal and confusion. But we are, at least, it turns out, in very good company among those who have long wrestled with the timeless question of how to mend a broken heart.",

      "text": "For all its many inconveniences and agonies, heartbreak appears to have a longstanding and curious power to push artists towards some of their very greatest creations, to heights that they will never again reach once stability has returned: to such masterpieces as Face Value (Phil Collins), Mrs Dalloway (Virginia Woolf), The Sorrows of Young Werther (Goethe), Odi et Amo (Catullus), Self-Portrait (Gwen John) and Blood on the Tracks (Bob Dylan). The link between heartbreak and creativity is striking – a testament to how loss can become a gateway to unexpected artistic truth.\nWhy should abandonment have such salutary side effects – and what, if anything, might those of us who have no plans to cut an album or paint a picture, but who may also have recently suffered a loss, derive from this phenomenon?\nThe Liberation of Not Caring\nWe might say that heartbreak encourages us, first and foremost, not to care anymore – and when we cease to do so, some remarkably true and essential things may emerge. By ‘caring’, we mean caring what the neighbours think, caring what it’s ‘nice’ or ‘wise’ to do, caring to be the good boys and girls we’ve aspired to be since childhood. Suddenly, under the weight of grief, none of it matters. We no longer give a damn what anyone thinks, so torn apart and wrecked are we. The person with whom we had imagined the rest of our lives has gone; everything settled and happy has dissolved, and nothing, truly nothing, retains its solidity. We might throw our belongings out of the window, shave our head, crawl naked across the central square, eat mud, spray-paint the apartment, swim out into the ocean and declare ourselves a horse or a lobster. We don’t care if anyone sees us weeping, or if we’re up at 3 a.m. walking in the park singing to ourselves. We don’t mind if we live or die.\nAnd such drastic conditions, far from presaging artistic chaos, may offer precisely the setting in which – finally – we throw off convention, timidity and fear and do what we’ve always longed, but felt too inhibited, to do. Sorrow unblocks our channels of feeling. Desperate, we speak in our authentic accents. Against a backdrop of despair, we risk saying it like it really is. We push our thoughts towards their most dangerous, unconventional conclusions; we articulate ourselves with heedless, unfrightened sincerity. Convention hasn’t saved us; we may as well trust oddity and waywardness. We surrender to our rawest instincts. It’s the last throw of the dice – a final bid before the jump.\nThe Link Between Heartbreak and Creativity\nThe great essayist Emerson once wrote: ‘In the minds of geniuses, we find our own neglected thoughts.’ And it may be our grief that lends us the bravery to be newly faithful to these neglected thoughts – and thereby ushers in our genius. The standard ideas have led us nowhere, only to our present misery and solitude, so let’s trust a little more in what we’ve actually been thinking all along but have been too shy to dare to think. Through our tear-stained disinhibition comes creativity. Works emerge that seem to presage and articulate everyone’s real intentions; that speak of how humankind would always wish to speak to itself, were it not so scared.\nLoss also helps us to notice what still remains precious. Most of existence feels plunged into darkness, excrement covers the earth – and yet, in the turmoil, one or two things stand out with new brilliance. We have to wait until we’re properly questioning whether we want to go on before we notice – as if for the first time – how ecstatic a flower can be, what gentle encouragement a tree might offer, what delicacy a fig can contain. The big pillars of contentment have been systematically blown up, but there is now room for the more neglected, yet in reality more essential, sources of joy to have their due. We begin to see the grace in a flock of birds, a field of lavender, an Emmental sandwich, a warm bath.\nGreat art is, in the end, mostly a business of some enlightened (though now we see, also heartbroken) person trying passionately to hold on to reasons to live, while telling us, in effect: notice the clouds; appreciate the apples; don’t bring things to an end before you’ve properly been awed by the spring, a child’s laughter, or four ducklings following their parents across a lake at dusk.\nAnother motive lurks behind artistic greatness: an intense wish for revenge. The abandonment has rocked the artist to the core. The rascal-like ex-partner is now with their best friend, on holiday in Morocco with the manager from the Berlin office or has run away to a cottage with a viscount from Austria. The sense of rejection and inferiority is beyond endurance. How could they do this to me? Why am I – with all my apparent brilliance, talent and sensitivity – not enough? What was missing? And from such shame and anger is born a new will to try yet harder, to make sure that the deserter will regret their perfidious cowardice for eternity. I may not be enough for you – you might think me boring or routine – but people not yet born will be stirred to the depths by the lyricism of what I am about to create. My work might not have satisfied you, but it will render your abandonment absurd for the ages. To leave the person who made In the Air Tonight (Phil), or Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (Vincent)&#8230; Be forever humbled by all that you’ve missed out on, all the sweetness and tenderness and complexity of the soul that you have turned away from – for Derek, Melanie or Luciano!&nbsp;\n\nVincent van Gogh, Vase with Twelve Sunflowers, 1888\n\nLater, of course, the artists recover. They forget about Derek – or Livia or Roisin, James or Akiko. The accolades come in and they find new, more loyal partners who love attending award ceremonies with them and will do up their Mediterranean holiday homes in soothing pastels (funded by royalties from their near-death experiences). And in the process, they grow pompous, happy and smug. No longer do they dare to see life with the freshness of despair. No longer does agony guide them towards the truth. They become frightened of losing the adulation of the crowd and so their output becomes sterile, imitative and largely forgettable.&nbsp;\nThe Gift of Suffering\nNone of this has to be about art narrowly conceived. It’s about how pain can keep us honest and how suffering awakens us to beauty and sweetness. It’s about the hidden gifts of loss and the connection between heartbreak and creativity. It’s about how we may have to wait until nothing makes sense anymore before we’re brave enough to pioneer true meaning. \nIt may – ultimately – be about allowing ourselves a moment of pride in our desperate state. There is very little that is fun about being heartbroken. It’s hard to wake up crying every morning for someone who is currently in bed with our old friend, or someone they hooked up with behind our back online. But there can be recompense in the ashes. We may never have thought so clearly before. We may never have been so alert or so alive. We may never have seen so much or been so kind. So much has been taken from us; and yet, we have gained a world.",

      "text": "‘Triangulation’ is a term used in psychoanalysis to refer to the way in which someone can be drawn to repeatedly introduce a third party into their two-person relationships, in order to reduce the risks that they unconsciously associate with singular dependence.\nThis theory posits that the ability to sustain a happy two-person relationship is never a given. It is reliant on a privileged emotional history; it is the fruit of a warm, sustained early dyadic relationship with a kindly and attuned parent or a caregiver. We will tolerate – and delight in – coupledom, if and only if, towards the start of our lives, we had an experience of focused devotion from another person: someone who held us tightly in mind, spent time with us and lent us the feeling that we satisfied them. Perhaps we were in the kitchen with them, neither of us talking much. They might have been busy with work while we sat in the corner with some bricks, but we knew they were there if we needed them, and we sensed how richly we existed in their imagination. We were their poppet, or their little monster, and it felt sweet – and more than enough. From this, we were able to draw a vital moral with a lifelong resonance: I can sustain another person’s attention, they won’t turn on me, two is sufficient, it can be safe, I don’t always have to look elsewhere, I can rely on someone, being in a couple can satisfy my needs.\nIt is no surprise that one of the most popular of all genres of painting in the Western tradition celebrates precisely these possibilities and pleasures: again and again, we see a mother and child depicted, satisfied in each other’s presence, wanting no others, cosy and at peace, while outside (in many works) the kingdom goes about its business and knights ride on horseback across a delicately delineated landscape. We project onto Mary and Jesus what we have all so badly wanted for ourselves.\n\nPerugino, Madonna and Child, c. 1501\n\nSadly, many of us have not been very fortunate in our search for dyadic experiences. Perhaps a parent was never there, or we felt that their most intense love was for a sibling. Maybe we had an impression that they were rivalrous and didn’t quite wish the best for us (they might have been prone to rage or sarcasm), or we felt that we had disappointed them in some fundamental way (we might have been born the wrong gender for them, or we didn’t like their chosen hobbies). From these crushing experiences, we derived another, less salutary moral: be careful never to depend on just one other person; love is highly exposing and threatening; men and women are a disappointment; spread out your allegiances to mitigate the agonies of forthcoming betrayals.\nAs a result, in adulthood, we may feel ineluctably drawn to weakening all two-person bonds. We may find ourselves flirting with others just as a relationship (in which we ostensibly believe) is starting to strengthen. An affair – whether imagined or real – becomes a necessary escape from the subterranean terrors of successful love.\nBut triangulation can take other, less obvious and less individuated forms. A ‘third’ can be anything that breaks the bond between the two partners. It could, for example, be a mobile phone that keeps cropping up between the pair and has to be consulted whenever the conversation grows too intense or meaningful. It might be a group of friends who continually have to be pulled in for meals, parties and holidays to ensure that closeness can be shattered and distance maintained (they may need to be contacted for their views in the middle of dinner or during a shopping trip). The third could be an obsession that removes a person from any chance of dialogue for long periods: a persistent worry about their reputation, anxiety about their appearance, an obsessive rivalry with a sibling, or a paranoia about something they might have done a decade before. The third could even be a therapist whom one member of a couple again and again uses to relativise their partner’s insights and perspectives: ‘Interesting you should think that – Ricardo thinks it’s actually about your mother …’ or ‘Kathryn wonders why I always have to ask you for your opinion …’\nWe should be generous with ourselves for our triangulating tendencies. We have them not because we are bad, but because we have suffered and because we were disappointed and terrified at an extremely vulnerable stage in our development. We might, with great kindness, try to explore our stance:\n— How do I feel about dyads?\n— To what extent am I tempted by a third?\n— What are my thirds of choice?\n— What might have gone awry in my early experience of couples?\nAt the same time, if we find ourselves in a relationship where the other person keeps finding ways to be elsewhere, we might learn to give a new, more encompassing name to their flights: we can say that behind the friends who keep being invited, the phone that is always drawn out, or the therapist who is wielded as a rivalrous source of authority, lies the pattern of triangulation.\nWith a deeper understanding of the concept, we may come to appreciate – perhaps as never before – what an extraordinary achievement of psychology and love it is to feel, at certain precious moments, as if two might very much be enough.",

A succession of small bits of bad news has come in over the past twenty-four hours. Someone’s unhappy with our performance at work; a customer has complained about our attention to detail; we have a traffic fine to pay; the milk has gone off; a friend is accusing us of not caring enough about them – and then, the final straw: someone we very much hoped to see for dinner has cancelled abruptly, with an unconvincing excuse about their mother.\nWe try to keep the different strands separate, but eventually, in the stillness of the small living room, they coalesce into an overwhelming impression: we’re not very worthy, there’s something wrong with us, we’re ugly inside and out, we’ve been like this since the start, no one likes us, we’re going to die alone – unhappy and mediocre.\nThe impression is stronger than we are. We curl into a ball and can’t hold back a tear, which rolls onto and is absorbed by the grey-green sofa. Ten minutes pass, then another twenty.\nFinally, we can’t take it any longer. We have to pull ourselves out of the spin. With a newfound urgency, we grab our jacket, run downstairs – and head for the nearby park.\n\nPhoto by Ian Thompson on Unsplash\n\nThis expanse of green was laid out by a group of enlightened planners and municipal engineers a few generations ago. There’s an inner and an outer circle, a small fountain, a playground and a statue of a man who pioneered research into bees. More importantly, the park has very little idea of us. It hasn’t heard of our place of employment; it doesn’t have any views on our romantic life; it couldn’t care less whether we are alive or dead – and this ignorance, far from crushing us further, has an immediately soothing effect.\nA grand oak tree, which has been sitting patiently in this spot for at least a hundred and fifty years, has priorities blessedly far from our own: it’s pulling nutrients from the soil, showing its freshest new leaves to the sun, providing a nesting place for robins and an athletic park for grey squirrels. The indifference is not nature’s alone. There’s a person in scrubs on a break from the nearby hospital, sitting on a bench with a flask of tea. They might later be fixing catheters on the children’s ward or ministering to a dying nonagenarian. To their left, a little boy is playing tag with his father. His joyful screams are unabashed; it’s a game, but something very serious – about love and self-esteem and having a home – is being exercised. Overhead, planes – perhaps heading back from Singapore or Madrid – are locking onto the final approach beacons at the airport to the west. In the distance, a line of uncomplaining pylons is bringing in electricity from the coast to power hairdryers and video games: our strange, extraordinary, bathetic species, in all its glory, complexity and mundanity.\nWith all this in view, it suddenly seems not to matter quite so much that we may – or may not – be a wretch; that a lover has let us down (heaven knows they might have their reasons, and we aren’t perfect either); or that we should, in all fairness, probably make more of an effort with our career. The individual ego diminishes; we let ourselves dissolve into a wider realm. What happens to us no longer has to be the measure of everything. We are – in part – also the trees, the houses, the clouds overhead, the pigeon who has come to peck at a leftover sandwich and the young boy now being hugged tightly by his dad. Our ultimate fate ceases to concern us so tightly. What does it matter quite so much what we’re worth or where we end up? We rejoin the ocean from which we had been in frightened exile for too long.\nNone of the elements that have helped us to recover our balance care to articulate a theory of existence; yet they may have one nevertheless. The oak tree has its own distinctive silent take on love, achievement, success and power – as do the clouds, the robins, the squirrels and the contrails. Each one of them is whispering, very quietly indeed: matter less, forget more, open your heart, let go of your resentments, surrender.\nWe can be so much happier when we manage – for a time – to still the clamour of the ‘I’ and live less intimately with ourselves; when we stop insisting that everything that happens to us must say something profound about us; when we can wear our fate more lightly. We may end up alone, we may be foolish, we may be sad. None of it, the park tells us, might matter too much anyway.\nWe’ll cope after all. Perhaps we’ll go to the cinema alone tonight. Or have a drink on the terrace. We haven’t just taken a walk; we’ve had a covert philosophy lesson.",

      "text": "When we hear certain stories of devastating heartbreak – the kind where the longing and the suffering seem limitless – it is normal to conclude that the people at their centre must have possessed truly unusual qualities. These tormentors must surely have been paragons of beauty, intelligence, sensitivity and kindness. How else to explain the scale of the devotion they inspired and the sadness that followed their departure? Why else would the abandoned lover, an otherwise rational and purposeful individual, have spent half a decade dwelling on their vanished angel, at the expense of their work, their health and their friendships?\nUntil one day, we may have a chance to get a closer look at the people who provoked the romantic anguish – perhaps in a book or online, at a party or in the street – and we come face-to-face with a different and far less logical picture. This lover, the object of Olympian grief – this Penelope or Hercules, Juliet or Zeus – may strike us as having very little in common with the divinity we had imagined. Could it really have been for this humdrum, routine example of a human being, this perhaps shifty, coarsely spoken, tin-eared character, this mean-spirited and banal mind, that a person lost the will to live? For this that they stopped eating and abandoned their duties, wrote impassioned poems, tore their clothes and contemplated a fall off a cliff? It sounds extremely puzzling – and almost funny.\nIn A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Shakespeare helps us laugh at this form of incongruous passion. Under the influence of a love potion placed on her eyelids by a mischievous spirit, Titania, Queen of the Fairies, wakes from a dream and falls in love with the very first person she sees, who happens to be a grotesque character called Bottom, a local tradesman who (as a result of another bit of magic) sports the head of a donkey. We chuckle as the lyrically spoken queen declares the brutish Bottom the finest thing ever to have lived, as she strokes his long ears, purrs at his asinine neighing and compares him to the noblest lovers of history. We laugh at an uncomfortable truth: how easily love incites us to devote ourselves to inappropriate and unworthy figures, how blindly we mistake donkeys for angels.\n\nEdwin Landseer, Scene from A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream. Titania and Bottom, 1851\n\nIn Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, the central character, a sophisticated and sensitive intellectual named Swann, arrives at a moment of sober realisation. For years he pursued a vain, status-conscious, unkind woman called Odette, whom he eventually persuaded to marry him – at the cost of his work, his reputation and his friendships. Now, finally, his obsession has waned, and he is able to take a cold-hearted look at the woman at its centre, reflecting sardonically: ‘To think that I wasted years of my life, that I wanted to die, that I had my greatest love, for a woman to whom I wasn’t attracted, who wasn’t even my type!’ (It sounds still more bathetic and resonant in French: ‘Dire que j’ai gâché des années de ma vie, que j’ai voulu mourir, que j’ai eu mon plus grand amour, pour une femme qui ne me plaisait pas, qui n’était pas mon genre!’).\nWhy do we waste years like this? Because we are lonely, because we carry an intense longing to believe, because it is unendurable to remain clear-eyed about what other people are, for the most, part actually like.\nBut there may be another, more psychological and still more poignant, dynamic at work. All children are born with a love potion placed on their eyelids. When they awaken to the world under the glare of the hospital lights, they – like Titania – fall in love almost automatically with the first people they see, those whom they will in time come to call ‘Mummy’ and ‘Daddy’. These ordinary mortals ineluctably acquire something supernatural in their offspring’s minds. They will – at least in the early years – be endowed with all manner of perfections. They are felt to understand the universe, to be heroes and heroines of limitless strength and intelligence, capable of pulling off magical feats as varied as baking a chocolate tart and throwing a ball as high as a tree.\nThere is very little choice in this idealisation. Children don’t love their parents according to merit, rather according to need. A parent who is violent, busy, alcoholic or abusive will attract love no less – and perhaps even to a greater extent – than one who is kind, patient and attuned.\nIt is precisely the children who had to cope with the least worthy parents – the mothers or fathers who stood in relation to them rather as the crude Bottom did to Titania – who are especially prone, in later life, to lose their hearts to roguish figures. It is as if their childhoods trained them to make creative excuses for their own maltreatment, to hold on to a belief in a more or less endurable and moral world. It is easier for them to hate themselves than to accept that their own parents might have done them an injustice. With time, a child who had no alternative but to love a mother or father who did them ill may grow up into an adult particularly susceptible to ignoring signs of unkindness in their partners. Love may not feel real or true until it is bound up – as it was at its point of origin – with exploitation and suffering.\nIt may be for this reason that many of us reserve our greatest and most obsessive loves not for people who are particularly marvellous, but for people who feel, first and foremost, extremely familiar – familiar in their degrees of shallowness, absence or vulgarity. With luck, we will in time wake up from our slumbers and realise, in the cold light of dawn, with a great deal of self-compassion, that we may for a while now have been cradling not an angel but a donkey.",

Or what about a special time near…? We long to create memories, isolate beauty, enjoy our senses: a fish place by the river, an Italian hilltop town, a Belgian art gallery. We invite restaurant owners, shopkeepers and museum curators to delight us. Half the commerce of the world is about decorating the early days with joy – blissful moments that may one day deepen the pain after a breakup.\n\nPhoto by Tim Collins on Unsplash\n\nThe Hidden Cost of Beautiful Beginnings\nBut if we are experienced at love, we know a darker truth. If love were ever to go wrong, these would be the centres of agony.\nWhen a relationship collapses, it isn’t the painful bits that we ever focus on. We don’t lament that we argued. We don’t cry that there was a hideous scene of jealousy outside the museum. We aren’t furious that they constantly misunderstood our relationship to our brother. All of this has been paid for already. It’s old news.\nWhat surges forward is something unexpected: the beautiful bits. The trip to the hills. The hotel room in Rio. The jacket we found for them in the little shop by the winding alleyway in Seville. The funfair in Helsinki.\nWe thought all these things had been laid to rest, that their recollection served no further function. But some nostalgic demon inside us insists on going to explore each one in ghastly detail.\nAnd so, a wariness may befall us as a new relationship builds: by all means, let’s do the lovely things. Let’s not avoid the picnic in the park. Let’s book the holiday to the islands. But there is also a suspicion and a fear: a Greek island, again …? Another trip to a gallery? Dare we really risk doing this? Dare we stop the car and suggest a swim in a lake, take a picnic blanket and go and buy cheese and bread from a farmer? Can we truly bear the cost if things were to go wrong, if they were to cool, if six months or years from now, they said they needed some space or wanted to pursue a job in another country?\nUnderstanding the Pain After a Breakup\nThere is no pleasure that isn’t an emotional catastrophe in waiting. There is no delightful moment that we won’t know how much we’ll have to suffer for until the end. The pain after a breakup is always rooted in joy. Call no lover happy till they die.",

      "text": "It is tear-inducing just how much can go wrong in love because we have failed to master a basic-sounding yet hugely important skill – one that would probably have been in place if our childhoods had given us the right experience: the art of saying how we feel, relatively close to when we actually feel it, in a way that can be heard, with gentleness and self-possession, before our affections are irreparably affected. This, in essence, is how to express your needs in a relationship: not with drama or accusation, but with sincerity and care.\nThe Risks of Being Too Accommodating\nImagine that we have been single for a long time. There have been many months, perhaps years, in which we wondered whether we deserved to be with someone, doubted our qualities and feared that love might never return.\nThen, unexpectedly, someone comes into our lives who seems a delightful prospect. They look nice, they can talk properly, they are interested in us, and we had tender chats.\nThen slowly, they begin to mention that they love sailing and that they share a small boat with friends out on the lake. Their excitement at being on the water is palpable. They are so keen for us to join them and enjoy their hobby. They mention an ex who wasn’t so enthusiastic – and what a pity that had been for them as a couple. The stakes feel high. So we go – of course we do – and we try very hard to be a good sailor. We compliment them on the (surprisingly tiny) boat, we admire the views, we help with the sails, we do our best with the stove. And then, after the third sleepless night, uncomfortable and exhausted, we can’t take it any longer. There’s a side of us that wants to scream at them for not noticing how ill at ease we feel, that hates them for their self-centred hobby and wants to swim to shore and never contact them again.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Stenholm on Unsplash\n\nThere are identical versions of this moment in other domains: the other loves long country walks. Or playing the guitar. Or talking about Hindu poetry. They garden constantly. Or they have a particular thing they like to do in bed which is painful and frightening.\nLearning the Language of Our Needs\nIn a better-arranged world, we would have been trained for such moments from an early age. Alongside lessons in physics and geography, we would have learnt – in our Emotional Communication classes – how to speak about our most intimate needs without causing upset.\nThe teacher would have told us to begin with a fundamental conviction: our needs are legitimate. There isn’t anything wrong with us for not liking sailing or not wanting to go on exhausting country walks or not being thrilled by horses or being scared of old churches. These aren’t problematic positions – they are just us.\nAt the same time, it isn’t fair or kind to say nothing at all and then, when we are at the end of our tether, to start shouting our needs, acting out our rage and blaming them for not being able to read our mind, when we have never taken care to open up to them.\nIt is incumbent on them to listen, of course, but it is equally incumbent on us to speak. We have to find our way to a poised manner of imparting difficult messages. In this ideal school, there would be competitions testing us playfully on how to handle the most difficult messages in the most effective ways. There would be prizes for the victors and a marshalling of the best competitive spirit.\nExample questions might include:\n– You are frightened by their religious convictions. What do you say?\n– You are uncomfortable with how close they are to their sister. What do you say?\n– They think you adore their cooking, and you don’t really. What do you say?\nTo prepare, there would be modules on the constituents of successfully phrased complaints:\n\nStart with reassurance: ‘I love you a lot, there’s just this thing…’ ‘Please know that I’m only speaking because of how much I care about you, and about us…’ ‘My respect for you is boundless. I wouldn’t be here otherwise, it’s just there is this thing…’\nState your position with a calm conviction in your right to speak: ‘There’s an issue I have about sleep…’ ‘For me, poetry has always been a matter of…’ ‘I know most people don’t see eye to eye with me on this, but…’\nGive them room to disagree. They don’t have to adopt your position – only acknowledge the differences with grace. You aren’t looking for perfect alignment, just a good enough understanding. ‘It’s fine that we might not be on the same page…’ ‘I know you can’t agree with me on this, but hopefully…’\nAnd if, even after this, things don’t go well – if they become furious or start to blame you – then you have done yourself an enormous favour. You’ve caught the problem early, and now – with sadness, but also haste – you must remove yourself from the situation and look elsewhere. Someone who has no space for your politely worded complaints cannot, whatever other qualities they may have, be a person for you. How to Express Your Needs in a Relationship‘It’s been a pleasure getting to know you to this point, but I don’t think we’d be doing either of us a favour if…’\n\nHow to Express Your Needs in a Relationship\nIdeally, we would have learnt all this at school. But it would, of course, be even better if the groundwork had been laid down at home. If, when our needs emerged, a parent was on hand to model for us how to say how we felt without causing discord on the one hand or abandoning ourselves on the other. It would help immensely if a parent had said, the first time we needed to go to the bathroom but felt an inhibition about asking: ‘You must always simply tell Mrs Jenson that you want to go. Put your hand up politely and they will understand.’ Or: ‘Just tell Sophie’s mother that you don’t like chocolate cake and you’ll be happy enough with something simple like bread and butter.’ And if this parent could also have lent us the sense that if someone has no room for our politely phrased complaint, then we have every right not to blame ourselves: ‘Well, that teacher doesn’t sound very kind, it’s not decent to behave like that…’\nThis matters because too many relationships falter on the basis that someone has lost their tongue. There is a limit to how long we can suffer in silence before love goes cold. We can’t keep having sex that makes us uncomfortable before we go off it entirely. We can’t keep sailing until we despise them for making us tired and sunburnt. We need to catch the problems while there is still goodwill.\nIt can seem that the enemy of love is being ‘difficult’. That, in order to be a good partner, we shouldn&#8217;t introduce too many discordant needs. But with time, we come to realise that the real enemy is not knowing how to express your needs in a relationship. We are allowed to be as complicated as we are – so long as we can explain how the world looks through our eyes. We don’t have to have ‘normal’ sleeping patterns, or ‘normal’ tastes in sex, or ‘normal’ views about animals. What we need is the skill of taking another person into our world so they can understand that we are at once good people and different people. We need a profound conviction that it is entirely possible to be ourselves and to be loved, so long as we have spoken gently. And that we won’t accept anything less – from them, or from ourselves.",

      "text": "We are, most of us, familiar with a particular kind of challenging human: the sort who seems unable to listen to much of what we might have to say to them. Their behaviour can be exasperating – yet it invites a deeper curiosity, one that touches on the psychology of not listening.\nWe mention we recently went on holiday to Greece … Really, they say, well they went there last year and there was a small hotel, and their friend said that … We explain that we suffered a flood in our house. What a pity, they reply, because here’s something about plumbing and the state of boilers in older properties. We note we have a colleague from Finland in our office. Well, during the Second World War, there was a battle near Helsinki where … There is nothing we might share – however urgent or sincere –that won’t very quickly be subsumed into one of their pre-existing, disconnected imperatives.\n\nPhoto by Logan Gutierrez on Unsplash\n\nThe Psychology of Not Listening\nWe’re used to considering such cases as stemming from a lack of manners. The person who talks relentlessly about themselves and their themes must – first and foremost – be rude. They haven’t been educated to consider others’ feelings. They have forgotten the laws of etiquette. They’re the equivalent, in the conversational domain, of a ruffian who wipes their mouth on the back of their hand or never writes thank-you letters.\nBut what appears as a lack of consideration may, in reality, stem from something far deeper and more psychological. We’re not dealing with an omission so much as a compulsion, not an excess but a deprivation. The person hasn’t just forgotten to listen; they’re unable to do so.\nAnd the reason is poignant: fear. The non-listener registers an acute sense of danger whenever they are called upon – in company – to attune to another’s reality, as though there was a stark choice: either them or us. They vaunt themselves, circle their pet themes and chatter endlessly to fight off a terror of annihilation. It isn’t egoism or over-confidence, but an extreme feeling of fragility and invisibility. The non-listener must shut others out in order to keep themselves alive. If they were to park their concerns for even a few moments (to ask us about our work, or our sore elbow), they might feel there would be nothing left of them when they returned.\nThe Roots of Generosity\nInevitably, there will be a sad backstory. They cannot listen because – for a long time, in the early years – they were not the focus of anyone else’s interest or delight. No one was especially charmed by their drawings; no one remembered their smaller sorrows and pains. It wasn’t amazing to anyone else that they existed. They have grown into the over-zealous guardians of a sense of specialness that they should have received from others from the start.\nTheir behaviour only serves to evoke what an achievement it is to be able, at times, to be the one who asks the questions and takes the back seat. If we can do this sincerely, it will be because someone, somewhere in our past, dropped to our level and tried to imagine the world through our eyes. Amidst their own cares and chores, someone gave us room. We came to them with a drawing (of a buttercup and a giant spider) and they asked us for the origins of our inspiration. They listened carefully when we told them of our plans for an underwater world or our fantasy of a wand that could turn furniture into chocolate. It was such early generosity that now makes it tolerable for us to immerse ourselves in the twists and turns of another’s breakup or a second cousin’s house move. We aren’t so much polite as fortunate.\nNone of this removes the problem, but it may just give us something a little more interesting to consider the next time we are bored into a claustrophobic stupor by one of our fragile, kind, wounded non-listening acquaintances: a chance to reflect, with compassion, on the psychology of not listening, and on what early absences might have made such behaviour feel like a necessity.",

      "text": "‘The Big Rock’ is an etching completed by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya in Madrid in 1810. It is - ostensibly - a representation of the world as we know it. It shows us some buildings, trees, animals, clouds.\n\nAnd yet, the more we look at the image, the stranger it becomes. Nothing is, on closer inspection, exactly as it should be. The two trees in the foreground are growing at a highly peculiar diagonal, blown by some unholy wind sweeping in across the valley. There’s a giant rock pointing in exactly the opposite direction, shaped like no rock we’ve ever seen before, threatening to topple over murderously. It’s as if nature has come unglued, and nothing, not even gravity, can be trusted. In the distance is what could be a monastery, a boarding school or a prison: an institution we wouldn’t want to be in, where guards are pacing, and inmates are keeping a threatening eye on the scene through barred windows. It speaks of all the places in society where order and care should reign - but which in reality typically hide discipline, cruelty, or abandonment. A building of reason and purpose, framed in a landscape of delirium. Then at the bottom left is what might be a long-necked donkey, passive, docile, resigned, used to the ways of its masters, perhaps about to lose its life to the crush of that uncanny rock. It is heartbreakingly unaware, it may be us, supinely facing doom, disassociated, keeping on with our grazing while the ground cracks open.\n\nIt’s a world gone silently entirely crazy, pretending to be sane while wholly unmoored. We might be walking through a particularly intense quiet nightmare, a moment of lucid psychosis.\n\nWe can feel grateful to Goya for going deep into our troubles - and his - to bring such an image into the daylight. He’s gone far into the underworld; an occult place away from the realm of our usual logic and facile sense of coherence. This is a world of perverse illogicality, in which we nevertheless all have a home.\n\nWe’re being invited, for a time, to recognise our collective folly: we, the animals, the institutions, our partners, our families, our ways of life. None of it makes sense in the way we tell ourselves insistently on bright mornings. Goya is not going to add to the sentimental hogwash. There’s latent threat and cruelty everywhere and this great man (he was by this stage deaf and afflicted by what we’d call manic depression) can bear to see it. We’re only pretending to be in control. The world isn’t right, the sanest among us know it and the kindest among us can bear to tell one another and commune around the pain. Here is an artist for when we are too sad, wild and exhausted to continue to pretend that everything makes sense, when we finally have an appetite for the true mystery and pain of being alive.\n\n"

      "text": "At the core of heartbreak lies a particularly cruel belief: the belief in our departed lover’s profound uniqueness. In the wake of our abandonment, we are visited by the certainty that our companion can and never will be replicated. It was precisely their way of tucking in their sleeves, of leaning forward in a restaurant, of navigating a train station, of closing their eyes in a kiss that made them who they were. And therefore, our grief can – despite the many inconveniences – fairly have no bounds. It is one of the defining emotional tasks of healing after a breakup to confront this belief and slowly, patiently, dismantle it.\n\nEdvard Munch, The Kiss, 1897\n\nWhen hearing our laments, well-meaning friends may – with great kindness – begin to point out what appears, from the outside, to be an almost obvious truth: that there are eight billion people on the planet and that the departed lover cannot, therefore, be fundamentally irreplaceable. That we must be exaggerating the difference between one person and another. That we must be guilty of turning a standard human into an irreplaceable deity.\nYet such kindly arguments hold no more force than a parent’s insistence to a young child that their favourite teddy, Nonou, forgotten in the crack between seats on a transatlantic flight, can be lightly replaced with a visit to a toyshop. Whatever the fine reasoning, we return to our sodden pillow with renewed sorrow.\nWhat We Truly Loved\nTo rescue ourselves, it may eventually be necessary to take on that driest of disciplines: philosophy – and in particular, the branch of it that considers the foundations of personal identity. We should dare to ask ourselves a peculiar-sounding question: what was it that we loved in our departed lover? At first, the enquiry may make little sense. We didn’t love anything as such – we just loved them: Roisin or Mateo, Keiko or Rajesh, Ximena or Yusuf, Layla and Santiago … There weren’t any reasons, there was only specialness, and now there is pain.\nBut we should stick at the question and, through our tears, try to tabulate certain ideas in response. What begins to emerge is that – in truth – our affection can’t ultimately have been just about their existence. It must have focused on certain qualities we perceived in them. When we reflect closely on why we loved them as we did, it was because of qualities: Roison’s tenderness, Mateo’s playfulness, Keiko’s sense of irony. &nbsp;In other words, though it seemed as if we loved a person purely and simply for themselves, what we really loved were a raft of qualities they harboured: their way of listening without judgment, their ability to find humour in mundane moments, their persistence in the face of obstacles, their curiosity about strangers&#8217; stories, their talent for finding beauty in ordinary places.\nHealing After a Breakup With a Qualities-Based Understanding of Love\nPhilosophy invites us to move from a person-based understanding of love to a qualities-based one; to shift from thinking that what made someone lovable was that they were Valentina or Kenji, Noor or Kwabena, to recognising that we loved them because they had a strong feeling of fairness or a dark sense of humour, an ease around children or a sensitivity to poetry\nWe might think this an arcane and incidental distinction – hardly worth the effort of making it. But it opens up an avenue for eventual recovery. For unlike a love of personhood, which is necessarily a&nbsp; singular phenomenon, a love of qualities of character exists free of any specific individual. Qualities, by their nature, are transpersonal – they are found across the species. They are the birthright of all humanity. Our lover borrowed them, made a temporary space for them, but they could not have created them or claimed a monopoly on them. They do not own justice or poetry; they do not have an eternal claim on humour or tolerance.\nIt can be a particular worry that, by starting up a new relationship, we will end up being disloyal to our ex. But according to this thesis, we can be properly loyal to a person we adored not by continuing to love them (when they no longer want us), but by continuing to love what we loved in them, in new people. We can shift our loyalty from the person’s name to the loveable qualities beneath their name – which we can search for and honour in a variety of alternative candidates, thereby preserving the basis of our affection despite the unwanted departure. By understanding more clearly why we loved them, we can loosen our obsessive focus on them. Our ex becomes less uniquely adorable once we become clearer about what we adored about being with them. We are not – by moving on from them – being asked to abandon what we loved. We’re being encouraged to locate those cherished traits in new domains.\nWhen we say we miss them, it is, in the end, something narrower we are nostalgic for: good qualities. It is tenderness, worldliness, conviviality or open-mindedness we loved – first and foremost – not, inherently, the bodily envelope in which these qualities came to rest. We encountered these things in them and with them, and so it’s natural to assume, at first, that losing the person means losing everything linked to them. It’s true that we’ll never meet another person exactly like the lover again. They are unique. But the good things we met in and through them are general. They exist elsewhere – not all bundled up in one person in quite the same way, but distributed more widely across the human race.\nOther versions of such smiles exist. Other versions of their sophisticated, slightly cynical take on life. Other capacities to make ambitious weekend plans or laugh at pomposity. In losing one person, we can’t logically have forever lost contact with the elements that made them valuable – elements that continue to exist, scattered throughout humanity, waiting for our curiosity and courage to re-emerge. Healing after a breakup involves this exact kind of shift: from the irreplaceable to the universal. We may have lost a person, but we haven’t lost – and don’t ever need to lose – what made them precious.",

Forty-five years old at the time of writing and already on his third marriage, Ovid had extensive personal experience of heartbreak, and knew too of its often tragic impact on friends and acquaintances. ‘Why should any lover hang from a high beam, a sad weight, with a knotted rope round his neck?’ he rued.\nAs a keen reader of legend and history, Ovid was also versed in the role of heartbreak in multiple appalling mythological tragedies: it was heartbreak that led Dido, Queen of Carthage, to take her own life; that drove Medea to kill her children; that caused Circe to lose her mind; and that inspired the Thracian princess Phyllis to hang herself after her lover Demophon left her to return to his native Athens. This was no light or laughing matter. The end of love might kill.\n\nAeneas and Dido, from a Roman fresco from the House of Citharist, Pompeii, Italy, c. 10BCE–45CE\n\nOvid’s Advice on How To Get Over a Breakup\nRead today, Cures for Love (Remedia Amoris in the original) speaks to us in the tone of a wise, occasionally stern, always concerned and kindly doctor. Ovid’s advice ranges across the field:\n— Have lots to do: ‘If you take away idleness, Cupid’s bow is unstrung… be busy, you’ll be safe’. Appease your yearning by going on a trip, entering politics or starting a business.\n— Stop idealising the departed lover: ‘Tell yourself often what your wicked girl has done and keep every hurt she inflicted before your eyes.’\n— Make an inventory of all the lover’s physical and psychological flaws and rehearse these every day: ‘I want you to become fluent in them!’\n— Don’t beg or lose your dignity in front of your ex: ‘Though, unhappy man, you may be roasting in the midst of Etna, make it seem to your girl that you’re chillier than ice… She’ll soon drop her disdain when she sees your indifference.’\n— Never go back to someone who has rejected you: ‘The door is wide open? Though you’re called to, pass by.’\n— Be careful of any communication: ‘If you love but don’t wish to, avoid making contact.’\n— Cut yourself off from the lover’s friends and family. Every reminder worsens the illness: ‘For you to reach dry land, it’s not enough for you to leave the girl. Say goodbye to her mother, sister and the nurse who’s in the know.’\n— Beware of memories: ‘Rereading letters shakes a steadfast heart.’\n— Delete photos: ‘Remove the wax images of her.’\n— Stay away from music and theatre. Avoid poetry too: ‘Disloyally I banish even my own gifts.’\n— Either drink so much you forget your grief – or drink nothing at all so you remember your wisdom: ‘if it’s anywhere between the two it’s bound to do you harm.’\n— Have a lot of new relationships: ‘Vast rivers are thinned out through many channels; fierce flames die down when the fuel’s removed.’ (In case we want to inscribe this on the wall in the original: Grandia per multos tenuantur flumina rivos / Saevaque diducto stipite flamma perit). ‘Let her be just one of many to you now.’\n— Spend time in the countryside. Get involved in gardening. Raise sheep. Cultivate vines.\n— Surround yourself with friends; avoid too much solitude: ‘Fear seclusion, men who’ve been hurt by women, women by men.’\n— Don’t get embittered or cross with exes: ‘That conclusion suits uncivilised natures.’\n— Don’t get petty about belongings and presents: ‘Tell her to keep the gifts you gave her.’\n— Forgive Cupid; he doesn’t know what he’s doing.\n— Expect it to take far, far longer than you wish: ‘Put faith more in love being extinguished slowly than suddenly.’\nDignity in Shared Suffering\nThe advice is consistently solid and applicable. But its true power arguably lies less in any particular recommendation than in the idea that someone, over two thousand years ago, understood exactly – with a freshness that might have us checking dates in disbelief – what now feels utterly agonising in its novelty and individuality.\nWe, who are mired in the specifics of our story, can raise our eyes and situate ourselves more accurately – and redemptively – in a boundless, timeless landscape of loss. None of this began when they started pulling away after the holidays or before their friend’s leaving party; it has been going on since the time of Homer and Augustus, since Romulus abandoned Remus and Mark Antony forsook his duties for Cleopatra. Long before the Crusades, the Beatles, the Battle of Lepanto or the construction of Chartres Cathedral, there were men and women shattering one another’s faith in everything by smiling wanly and asking for a bit more space. This disaster has been unfolding for a very, very long time. It is no personal flaw, no reflection of a modern, technologically-inspired malaise. The affliction is encoded in our humanity.\nBut the ancientness dignifies the relentless crying we did in the bathroom last weekend. We aren’t just weak. We stand in a line of mighty lovers who have been felled by their partner’s changes of mind. We’re going through what the Queen of Carthage endured; we’re suffering as Thracian royalty did. We are partaking in one of the oldest, grandest forms of sorrow.\nIt may help that Ovid’s advice is expressed in an antique tongue we’re unlikely to understand. When he writes successore novo vincitur omnis amor (‘every love is defeated by a fresh successor’),&nbsp; it matters less what’s being said than that it’s being said in a Latin once spoken from the shores of Britannia to the banks of the Euphrates –in the language of those who built the Colosseum and the Pantheon, fought in the battles of Actium and Cannae, made goblets now held in the museum of the Vatican, and wrote down inventories of olive oil in the markets of Hispania. It is a cadenced, alien language that draws a line across time from the Roman Forum to the desk where you now sit, scrolling through your phone, pretending to work, eating too many biscuits, looking out at the trees, wondering where it all went wrong.\nIt’s not pretentious to delight when Ovid keeps referring to strange historical and mythological characters – when he tells us that ‘Callirhoe made Alcmaeon share her bed, lest he always love Alphesiboea.’ Or that Orestes’s pain after killing Clytemnestra was soothed by the friendship of the loyal Pylades. The allusions help relativise our mess. We, who’ve been ripped open by our perfidious sweetheart, who were going to go skiing with them next winter and start work on the garden together, can now make some unexpected suffering friends from foreign lands and eras. It hurts like hell; but at least it’s not – on top of everything else – in any way new.\nHow to Mend a Broken Heart\nWe need so much reassurance. We are terrified. The pain doesn’t seem to end. We so badly want someone to have walked this path before, and to tell us that there will be some kind of bearable conclusion. Ovid is sure there will be. He finishes his book by telling Cupid that he knows how to outwit him – and by reminding Dido that if only she had been able to take his advice, she’d still be alive.\nOur little wretch from Instagram – who gashed our heart and destroyed our peace – may presently be partying without remorse in Brooklyn or Lima, Melbourne or Jakarta. We may be horribly alone with our betrayal and confusion. But we are, at least, it turns out, in very good company among those who have long wrestled with the timeless question of how to mend a broken heart.",

      "text": "For all its many inconveniences and agonies, heartbreak appears to have a longstanding and curious power to push artists towards some of their very greatest creations, to heights that they will never again reach once stability has returned: to such masterpieces as Face Value (Phil Collins), Mrs Dalloway (Virginia Woolf), The Sorrows of Young Werther (Goethe), Odi et Amo (Catullus), Self-Portrait (Gwen John) and Blood on the Tracks (Bob Dylan). The link between heartbreak and creativity is striking – a testament to how loss can become a gateway to unexpected artistic truth.\nWhy should abandonment have such salutary side effects – and what, if anything, might those of us who have no plans to cut an album or paint a picture, but who may also have recently suffered a loss, derive from this phenomenon?\nThe Liberation of Not Caring\nWe might say that heartbreak encourages us, first and foremost, not to care anymore – and when we cease to do so, some remarkably true and essential things may emerge. By ‘caring’, we mean caring what the neighbours think, caring what it’s ‘nice’ or ‘wise’ to do, caring to be the good boys and girls we’ve aspired to be since childhood. Suddenly, under the weight of grief, none of it matters. We no longer give a damn what anyone thinks, so torn apart and wrecked are we. The person with whom we had imagined the rest of our lives has gone; everything settled and happy has dissolved, and nothing, truly nothing, retains its solidity. We might throw our belongings out of the window, shave our head, crawl naked across the central square, eat mud, spray-paint the apartment, swim out into the ocean and declare ourselves a horse or a lobster. We don’t care if anyone sees us weeping, or if we’re up at 3 a.m. walking in the park singing to ourselves. We don’t mind if we live or die.\nAnd such drastic conditions, far from presaging artistic chaos, may offer precisely the setting in which – finally – we throw off convention, timidity and fear and do what we’ve always longed, but felt too inhibited, to do. Sorrow unblocks our channels of feeling. Desperate, we speak in our authentic accents. Against a backdrop of despair, we risk saying it like it really is. We push our thoughts towards their most dangerous, unconventional conclusions; we articulate ourselves with heedless, unfrightened sincerity. Convention hasn’t saved us; we may as well trust oddity and waywardness. We surrender to our rawest instincts. It’s the last throw of the dice – a final bid before the jump.\nThe Link Between Heartbreak and Creativity\nThe great essayist Emerson once wrote: ‘In the minds of geniuses, we find our own neglected thoughts.’ And it may be our grief that lends us the bravery to be newly faithful to these neglected thoughts – and thereby ushers in our genius. The standard ideas have led us nowhere, only to our present misery and solitude, so let’s trust a little more in what we’ve actually been thinking all along but have been too shy to dare to think. Through our tear-stained disinhibition comes creativity. Works emerge that seem to presage and articulate everyone’s real intentions; that speak of how humankind would always wish to speak to itself, were it not so scared.\nLoss also helps us to notice what still remains precious. Most of existence feels plunged into darkness, excrement covers the earth – and yet, in the turmoil, one or two things stand out with new brilliance. We have to wait until we’re properly questioning whether we want to go on before we notice – as if for the first time – how ecstatic a flower can be, what gentle encouragement a tree might offer, what delicacy a fig can contain. The big pillars of contentment have been systematically blown up, but there is now room for the more neglected, yet in reality more essential, sources of joy to have their due. We begin to see the grace in a flock of birds, a field of lavender, an Emmental sandwich, a warm bath.\nGreat art is, in the end, mostly a business of some enlightened (though now we see, also heartbroken) person trying passionately to hold on to reasons to live, while telling us, in effect: notice the clouds; appreciate the apples; don’t bring things to an end before you’ve properly been awed by the spring, a child’s laughter, or four ducklings following their parents across a lake at dusk.\nAnother motive lurks behind artistic greatness: an intense wish for revenge. The abandonment has rocked the artist to the core. The rascal-like ex-partner is now with their best friend, on holiday in Morocco with the manager from the Berlin office or has run away to a cottage with a viscount from Austria. The sense of rejection and inferiority is beyond endurance. How could they do this to me? Why am I – with all my apparent brilliance, talent and sensitivity – not enough? What was missing? And from such shame and anger is born a new will to try yet harder, to make sure that the deserter will regret their perfidious cowardice for eternity. I may not be enough for you – you might think me boring or routine – but people not yet born will be stirred to the depths by the lyricism of what I am about to create. My work might not have satisfied you, but it will render your abandonment absurd for the ages. To leave the person who made In the Air Tonight (Phil), or Vase with Twelve Sunflowers (Vincent)&#8230; Be forever humbled by all that you’ve missed out on, all the sweetness and tenderness and complexity of the soul that you have turned away from – for Derek, Melanie or Luciano!&nbsp;\n\nVincent van Gogh, Vase with Twelve Sunflowers, 1888\n\nLater, of course, the artists recover. They forget about Derek – or Livia or Roisin, James or Akiko. The accolades come in and they find new, more loyal partners who love attending award ceremonies with them and will do up their Mediterranean holiday homes in soothing pastels (funded by royalties from their near-death experiences). And in the process, they grow pompous, happy and smug. No longer do they dare to see life with the freshness of despair. No longer does agony guide them towards the truth. They become frightened of losing the adulation of the crowd and so their output becomes sterile, imitative and largely forgettable.&nbsp;\nThe Gift of Suffering\nNone of this has to be about art narrowly conceived. It’s about how pain can keep us honest and how suffering awakens us to beauty and sweetness. It’s about the hidden gifts of loss and the connection between heartbreak and creativity. It’s about how we may have to wait until nothing makes sense anymore before we’re brave enough to pioneer true meaning. \nIt may – ultimately – be about allowing ourselves a moment of pride in our desperate state. There is very little that is fun about being heartbroken. It’s hard to wake up crying every morning for someone who is currently in bed with our old friend, or someone they hooked up with behind our back online. But there can be recompense in the ashes. We may never have thought so clearly before. We may never have been so alert or so alive. We may never have seen so much or been so kind. So much has been taken from us; and yet, we have gained a world.",

      "text": "‘Triangulation’ is a term used in psychoanalysis to refer to the way in which someone can be drawn to repeatedly introduce a third party into their two-person relationships, in order to reduce the risks that they unconsciously associate with singular dependence.\nThis theory posits that the ability to sustain a happy two-person relationship is never a given. It is reliant on a privileged emotional history; it is the fruit of a warm, sustained early dyadic relationship with a kindly and attuned parent or a caregiver. We will tolerate – and delight in – coupledom, if and only if, towards the start of our lives, we had an experience of focused devotion from another person: someone who held us tightly in mind, spent time with us and lent us the feeling that we satisfied them. Perhaps we were in the kitchen with them, neither of us talking much. They might have been busy with work while we sat in the corner with some bricks, but we knew they were there if we needed them, and we sensed how richly we existed in their imagination. We were their poppet, or their little monster, and it felt sweet – and more than enough. From this, we were able to draw a vital moral with a lifelong resonance: I can sustain another person’s attention, they won’t turn on me, two is sufficient, it can be safe, I don’t always have to look elsewhere, I can rely on someone, being in a couple can satisfy my needs.\nIt is no surprise that one of the most popular of all genres of painting in the Western tradition celebrates precisely these possibilities and pleasures: again and again, we see a mother and child depicted, satisfied in each other’s presence, wanting no others, cosy and at peace, while outside (in many works) the kingdom goes about its business and knights ride on horseback across a delicately delineated landscape. We project onto Mary and Jesus what we have all so badly wanted for ourselves.\n\nPerugino, Madonna and Child, c. 1501\n\nSadly, many of us have not been very fortunate in our search for dyadic experiences. Perhaps a parent was never there, or we felt that their most intense love was for a sibling. Maybe we had an impression that they were rivalrous and didn’t quite wish the best for us (they might have been prone to rage or sarcasm), or we felt that we had disappointed them in some fundamental way (we might have been born the wrong gender for them, or we didn’t like their chosen hobbies). From these crushing experiences, we derived another, less salutary moral: be careful never to depend on just one other person; love is highly exposing and threatening; men and women are a disappointment; spread out your allegiances to mitigate the agonies of forthcoming betrayals.\nAs a result, in adulthood, we may feel ineluctably drawn to weakening all two-person bonds. We may find ourselves flirting with others just as a relationship (in which we ostensibly believe) is starting to strengthen. An affair – whether imagined or real – becomes a necessary escape from the subterranean terrors of successful love.\nBut triangulation can take other, less obvious and less individuated forms. A ‘third’ can be anything that breaks the bond between the two partners. It could, for example, be a mobile phone that keeps cropping up between the pair and has to be consulted whenever the conversation grows too intense or meaningful. It might be a group of friends who continually have to be pulled in for meals, parties and holidays to ensure that closeness can be shattered and distance maintained (they may need to be contacted for their views in the middle of dinner or during a shopping trip). The third could be an obsession that removes a person from any chance of dialogue for long periods: a persistent worry about their reputation, anxiety about their appearance, an obsessive rivalry with a sibling, or a paranoia about something they might have done a decade before. The third could even be a therapist whom one member of a couple again and again uses to relativise their partner’s insights and perspectives: ‘Interesting you should think that – Ricardo thinks it’s actually about your mother …’ or ‘Kathryn wonders why I always have to ask you for your opinion …’\nWe should be generous with ourselves for our triangulating tendencies. We have them not because we are bad, but because we have suffered and because we were disappointed and terrified at an extremely vulnerable stage in our development. We might, with great kindness, try to explore our stance:\n— How do I feel about dyads?\n— To what extent am I tempted by a third?\n— What are my thirds of choice?\n— What might have gone awry in my early experience of couples?\nAt the same time, if we find ourselves in a relationship where the other person keeps finding ways to be elsewhere, we might learn to give a new, more encompassing name to their flights: we can say that behind the friends who keep being invited, the phone that is always drawn out, or the therapist who is wielded as a rivalrous source of authority, lies the pattern of triangulation.\nWith a deeper understanding of the concept, we may come to appreciate – perhaps as never before – what an extraordinary achievement of psychology and love it is to feel, at certain precious moments, as if two might very much be enough.",

      "text": "Imagine that we’ve been in the apartment by ourselves since the previous evening, and now, at the start of the weekend, it’s eleven in the morning. A succession of small bits of bad news has come in over the past twenty-four hours. Someone’s unhappy with our performance at work; a customer has complained about our attention to detail; we have a traffic fine to pay; the milk has gone off; a friend is accusing us of not caring enough about them – and then, the final straw: someone we very much hoped to see for dinner has cancelled abruptly, with an unconvincing excuse about their mother.\nWe try to keep the different strands separate, but eventually, in the stillness of the small living room, they coalesce into an overwhelming impression: we’re not very worthy, there’s something wrong with us, we’re ugly inside and out, we’ve been like this since the start, no one likes us, we’re going to die alone – unhappy and mediocre.\nThe impression is stronger than we are. We curl into a ball and can’t hold back a tear, which rolls onto and is absorbed by the grey-green sofa. Ten minutes pass, then another twenty.\nFinally, we can’t take it any longer. We have to pull ourselves out of the spin. With a newfound urgency, we grab our jacket, run downstairs – and head for the nearby park.\n\nPhoto by Ian Thompson on Unsplash\n\nThis expanse of green was laid out by a group of enlightened planners and municipal engineers a few generations ago. There’s an inner and an outer circle, a small fountain, a playground and a statue of a man who pioneered research into bees. More importantly, the park has very little idea of us. It hasn’t heard of our place of employment; it doesn’t have any views on our romantic life; it couldn’t care less whether we are alive or dead – and this ignorance, far from crushing us further, has an immediately soothing effect.\nA grand oak tree, which has been sitting patiently in this spot for at least a hundred and fifty years, has priorities blessedly far from our own: it’s pulling nutrients from the soil, showing its freshest new leaves to the sun, providing a nesting place for robins and an athletic park for grey squirrels. The indifference is not nature’s alone. There’s a person in scrubs on a break from the nearby hospital, sitting on a bench with a flask of tea. They might later be fixing catheters on the children’s ward or ministering to a dying nonagenarian. To their left, a little boy is playing tag with his father. His joyful screams are unabashed; it’s a game, but something very serious – about love and self-esteem and having a home – is being exercised. Overhead, planes – perhaps heading back from Singapore or Madrid – are locking onto the final approach beacons at the airport to the west. In the distance, a line of uncomplaining pylons is bringing in electricity from the coast to power hairdryers and video games: our strange, extraordinary, bathetic species, in all its glory, complexity and mundanity.\nWith all this in view, it suddenly seems not to matter quite so much that we may – or may not – be a wretch; that a lover has let us down (heaven knows they might have their reasons, and we aren’t perfect either); or that we should, in all fairness, probably make more of an effort with our career. The individual ego diminishes; we let ourselves dissolve into a wider realm. What happens to us no longer has to be the measure of everything. We are – in part – also the trees, the houses, the clouds overhead, the pigeon who has come to peck at a leftover sandwich and the young boy now being hugged tightly by his dad. Our ultimate fate ceases to concern us so tightly. What does it matter quite so much what we’re worth or where we end up? We rejoin the ocean from which we had been in frightened exile for too long.\nNone of the elements that have helped us to recover our balance care to articulate a theory of existence; yet they may have one nevertheless. The oak tree has its own distinctive silent take on love, achievement, success and power – as do the clouds, the robins, the squirrels and the contrails. Each one of them is whispering, very quietly indeed: matter less, forget more, open your heart, let go of your resentments, surrender.\nWe can be so much happier when we manage – for a time – to still the clamour of the ‘I’ and live less intimately with ourselves; when we stop insisting that everything that happens to us must say something profound about us; when we can wear our fate more lightly. We may end up alone, we may be foolish, we may be sad. None of it, the park tells us, might matter too much anyway.\nWe’ll cope after all. Perhaps we’ll go to the cinema alone tonight. Or have a drink on the terrace. We haven’t just taken a walk; we’ve had a covert philosophy lesson.",

      "text": "When we hear certain stories of devastating heartbreak – the kind where the longing and the suffering seem limitless – it is normal to conclude that the people at their centre must have possessed truly unusual qualities. These tormentors must surely have been paragons of beauty, intelligence, sensitivity and kindness. How else to explain the scale of the devotion they inspired and the sadness that followed their departure? Why else would the abandoned lover, an otherwise rational and purposeful individual, have spent half a decade dwelling on their vanished angel, at the expense of their work, their health and their friendships?\nUntil one day, we may have a chance to get a closer look at the people who provoked the romantic anguish – perhaps in a book or online, at a party or in the street – and we come face-to-face with a different and far less logical picture. This lover, the object of Olympian grief – this Penelope or Hercules, Juliet or Zeus – may strike us as having very little in common with the divinity we had imagined. Could it really have been for this humdrum, routine example of a human being, this perhaps shifty, coarsely spoken, tin-eared character, this mean-spirited and banal mind, that a person lost the will to live? For this that they stopped eating and abandoned their duties, wrote impassioned poems, tore their clothes and contemplated a fall off a cliff? It sounds extremely puzzling – and almost funny.\nIn A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Shakespeare helps us laugh at this form of incongruous passion. Under the influence of a love potion placed on her eyelids by a mischievous spirit, Titania, Queen of the Fairies, wakes from a dream and falls in love with the very first person she sees, who happens to be a grotesque character called Bottom, a local tradesman who (as a result of another bit of magic) sports the head of a donkey. We chuckle as the lyrically spoken queen declares the brutish Bottom the finest thing ever to have lived, as she strokes his long ears, purrs at his asinine neighing and compares him to the noblest lovers of history. We laugh at an uncomfortable truth: how easily love incites us to devote ourselves to inappropriate and unworthy figures, how blindly we mistake donkeys for angels.\n\nEdwin Landseer, Scene from A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream. Titania and Bottom, 1851\n\nIn Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, the central character, a sophisticated and sensitive intellectual named Swann, arrives at a moment of sober realisation. For years he pursued a vain, status-conscious, unkind woman called Odette, whom he eventually persuaded to marry him – at the cost of his work, his reputation and his friendships. Now, finally, his obsession has waned, and he is able to take a cold-hearted look at the woman at its centre, reflecting sardonically: ‘To think that I wasted years of my life, that I wanted to die, that I had my greatest love, for a woman to whom I wasn’t attracted, who wasn’t even my type!’ (It sounds still more bathetic and resonant in French: ‘Dire que j’ai gâché des années de ma vie, que j’ai voulu mourir, que j’ai eu mon plus grand amour, pour une femme qui ne me plaisait pas, qui n’était pas mon genre!’).\nWhy do we waste years like this? Because we are lonely, because we carry an intense longing to believe, because it is unendurable to remain clear-eyed about what other people are, for the most, part actually like.\nBut there may be another, more psychological and still more poignant, dynamic at work. All children are born with a love potion placed on their eyelids. When they awaken to the world under the glare of the hospital lights, they – like Titania – fall in love almost automatically with the first people they see, those whom they will in time come to call ‘Mummy’ and ‘Daddy’. These ordinary mortals ineluctably acquire something supernatural in their offspring’s minds. They will – at least in the early years – be endowed with all manner of perfections. They are felt to understand the universe, to be heroes and heroines of limitless strength and intelligence, capable of pulling off magical feats as varied as baking a chocolate tart and throwing a ball as high as a tree.\nThere is very little choice in this idealisation. Children don’t love their parents according to merit, rather according to need. A parent who is violent, busy, alcoholic or abusive will attract love no less – and perhaps even to a greater extent – than one who is kind, patient and attuned.\nIt is precisely the children who had to cope with the least worthy parents – the mothers or fathers who stood in relation to them rather as the crude Bottom did to Titania – who are especially prone, in later life, to lose their hearts to roguish figures. It is as if their childhoods trained them to make creative excuses for their own maltreatment, to hold on to a belief in a more or less endurable and moral world. It is easier for them to hate themselves than to accept that their own parents might have done them an injustice. With time, a child who had no alternative but to love a mother or father who did them ill may grow up into an adult particularly susceptible to ignoring signs of unkindness in their partners. Love may not feel real or true until it is bound up – as it was at its point of origin – with exploitation and suffering.\nIt may be for this reason that many of us reserve our greatest and most obsessive loves not for people who are particularly marvellous, but for people who feel, first and foremost, extremely familiar – familiar in their degrees of shallowness, absence or vulgarity. With luck, we will in time wake up from our slumbers and realise, in the cold light of dawn, with a great deal of self-compassion, that we may for a while now have been cradling not an angel but a donkey.",

      "text": "Heartbreak is a paradoxical state in which, for a time – very strangely – we take the side of the very person who has hurt us and never wants to be intimate with us again, without quite realising the extent to which we have abandoned ourselves and equated the agent of our agony with goodness.\nInstead of immediately turning against our former lover for the devastation they have caused us, for an extended period, we simply miss them with new intensity. We weep with regret for, rather than hate, our tormentor. Instead of celebrating the departure of a miscreant from our lives, we look through old photos and whisper their name with tenderness. We recall every kindness they ever bestowed, we circle obsessively around their best sides, we picture the cosy dinners we once shared with them and the moments when they told us their sorrows and we held them close. With painful illogicality, we miss, and long for reassurance from, precisely the person who actively sought to be rid of us for eternity.\nIn our efforts to remain loyal to our ex, we have no option but to grow highly imaginative about what might have led to their departure: maybe they didn’t really intend for any of this to happen. It’s all been a very weird mistake. They couldn’t have meant such cruelty. They’d be so sad if they saw us crying. They’d be jealous if they saw us attempting to set up dates with other people. They must have been seized by some temporary, extraneous force that put them into a kind of narcoleptic state from which they will soon wake up. They do love us deep down. They’re just going through some inner troubles and will imminently remember what we mean to them.\n\nPhoto by Kevin Mueller on Unsplash\n\nAlong the way, we hardly notice that they ruined the holidays, destroyed our confidence, upset our health, put an entirely unnecessary toll on our mental state – and didn’t apologise or thank us for our sacrifices. We’re too busy thinking of how sweet they are and how complicated their early life was.\nWe start to wonder what horrible aspects of us might have provoked our abandonment. Surely we were excessive in our demands. Silly us, for wanting to see them! How clingy, to mind that they were never there! How obsessive, to be jealous about the infidelities!\nOf course, these contortions don’t help our self-esteem. How awful we must be, if such a good person decides to quit our company. How could we be of any value, if someone so blameless, who has known us from close up, realises they’ve had enough? We don’t put any of this quite so clearly, but deep down, we don’t want to live very much.\nFor a long time, these torturing thoughts seem to make all the sense. And then eventually – it might be after five months, or five years (after hours of therapy, a great many conversations with friends and hundreds of long walks in the park) – there is a new dawn. A fresh set of ideas take root. We can hardly imagine why they were ever so hard to believe in, and it’s their opposites that are recast as wholly alien:\n— The ex isn’t, in any way, our friend. They consciously and strategically threw us away. Not to put too fine a point on it: they didn’t want us. They had enough of us. They actively sought to spend the rest of their life without us. They wanted to admire, have sex with and adore someone else.\n— This isn’t a person whose side we should ever be on again. They may have smiled and said sweet things on their way out the door, but they didn’t fundamentally mean any of it, because in their actions they sought to pulverise and annihilate the world we had constructed with them. They weren’t asleep while they did so. They weren’t drugged. They didn’t mind one bit that we were crying – they just didn’t want to be too close or  feel uncomfortable about it.\n— This wasn’t a mistake. They wanted it. All of it. They will have plotted for it. They will have talked to their friends ahead of time. This was a strategy, a deliberate intention. What happened was exactly what they wanted (very, very badly) to happen.\n— There was someone else. Not necessarily in their bed, but in their fantasies. They didn’t leave us for a blank; they weren’t planning to join a celibate religious order. They were upgrading. They dreamt of a better life. They did this on one basis only: a powerful feeling that they could swap us for a superior candidate.\n— This isn’t – of course – someone we should be crying over. This isn’t someone we should, for one moment longer, think of as adorable. This is not our ally. We’re done thinking about someone who opted, in broad daylight, to expel us. It’s not disloyal to try to love someone else; it’s a sign of our new loyalty to ourselves.\nSuddenly, the heartbreak makes no sense. We don’t love this person anymore; we want them far away from us. We shudder to recall how much we believed in them. Someone can’t be ‘our person’ – and not want to be with us. We wonder why we didn’t think like this from the beginning. And the answer is because love is very slow to fade. It isn’t built out of logic, but out of the slower, less viscous moods of the heart. We’re like a loyal dog who kept returning for another slap from a volatile owner, unable to believe that they were being mistreated by someone who was once very kind. It took a long time, and many hits – but this dog has learnt. This dog isn’t going to play the game any more. After a while, even the most loyal animal gets the message and moves on. We don’t love them anymore; and we’re free.",

      "text": "Dating is ostensibly the business of searching for someone to love – but for it to go well, it requires us first to work on a much more fundamental relationship: the one that we have with ourselves. We won’t be successful daters – or indeed, successful lovers – if we haven’t first reached a healthy perspective on our own natures. Dating presents us with the ultimate test of our powers of discernment and of our sense of self-worth.\nWhat exactly does it mean to suggest that we may need to learn to love ourselves before we try to love someone else? It means that we won’t be in any position to work out who is kind and good, who is worth investing in, until we are firmly on our own side. We need to have overcome our self-suspicion, to be sure of what we deserve and to have a healthy sense of our value – in order to correctly judge who could adequately reward our presence and in order not to despair at all the rejection we will inevitably encounter on our journey to love.\n\nHenri Matisse, Interior with a Young Girl (Girl Reading), 1905-1906\n\nHere are some of the many rules, born out of adequate self-love, that stand a chance of keeping us safe and more or less calm during the turbulence of the dating process:\n— If they take an age to answer a message, we must walk away.\n— If we feel obligated but, deep down, don’t feel comfortable, we must walk away.\n— If they make us feel ashamed or scared, we must walk away.\n— If we need to keep reminding ourselves that they are right on paper, but something in our depths stubbornly says ‘no’, we must walk away.\n— We must forever banish the idea that choice is limited. It is, in its way, infinite. There will always be other people. The pool is constantly being refilled. The situation can change in an instant. We must wait as long as we need to.\n— We should spell out what we want clearly, early on. If they run away immediately, they would have done so eventually in any case; we’re merely saving ourselves time.\n— We should try hard not to go off people who threaten to be nice to us.\n— We should strive not to fall in love at once with those who ignore us.\n— We should accept with grace that most people won’t want us. We’re really not for everyone. And we don’t want most people either. This is going to be an exercise in the million perplexing ways in which one human can fall short of another’s hopes. We aren’t being wilfully fussy. We are interviewing for the most important job in our lives. We are trying to stay true to a legitimately distinctive vision of happiness. We have no option but to be very difficult.\n— We only have to be lucky once. We’re trying to fill a single, very important chair – not a bus.\n— If there is an ex in our background haunting us with a sense that it could have been better with them, it evidently couldn’t – or we wouldn’t be here. Let’s not compound our difficulties with nostalgia. Exes became exes for solid reasons.\n— We probably fought very hard to untangle ourselves from a past partner. Honour the effort that went into giving ourselves a chance for something ‘better’.\n— Don’t be too jealous of the married and the settled. Life has a habit of eventually forcing everyone to take equal sips from the cup of sorrow.\n— Details are where large incompatibilities first manifest themselves. It shouldn’t feel strange to call it a day because of an unfortunate sentence or word on their part.\n— Watch out, in dating as in relationships, for the so-called polite, people-pleasing, cowardly, shape-shifting ones: those whose disinterest wears a smile, and who waste so much time of our time with their dread of being rude or unkind.\n— Some people are going to be plain unwell. Mental illness is a reality for a fair percentage of the population; we should be ready.\n— However auspicious a situation might appear, we must assume nothing too readily. We won’t know for sure for a very long time. We must quash premature enthusiasm – so as never to pay an undue price for it down the line. We must keep repeating, like a mantra, every time promise dawns: ‘… but we just can’t tell yet’.\n— Attraction matters. This isn’t an unholy or cheap demand; this is more than merely friendship. We should candidly register when the feeling is missing – and move on without shame.\n— We mustn’t go to bed too soon; it creates obligations that will be exhausting to work our way out of. Let physical intimacy be the result of confidence in their emotional rightness – not an attempt to catalyse a bond. There will be plenty of time for all of that later.\n— Take regular breaks. These auditions are terrifying. We are right to feel tearful and fed up. It is appalling to have to write and then delete so many scripts for our possible futures. It is sad to keep realising how far we are from home.\n— Try to identify a kind, concerned friend on whom to rely for counsel when perspective starts to slip and madness threatens; they will help.\n— We should notice – more than we’re usually encouraged to – whether or not they interest us. Are their minds richly filled? Do they make us feel cleverer than we feel on our own? Do we want to know what they think? We might have to spend another 7,000 dinners with them.\n— We should refuse all non-reciprocal situations. They are either keen on us – viscerally keen – or we must walk away. We aren’t here to coax, beg or drag the semi-willing.\n— We should be ready for numberless rejections and drain them of too much meaning. We mustn’t turn them into referenda on our right to exist. They are about poor alignment, not about every loss we’ve ever had.\n— We must know that we can be alone, possibly forever, if we have to. It is conclusively better to remain single until eternity than to give room to a compromise candidate. Solitude at least allows us – always – to maintain hope.\n— Let it take as long as it has to. If we are still here this time next year, and the year after that, so be it.\nDating is an extremely demanding process. We will often feel close to surrender and folly. But the more we are on our side, the more we will be able to hold in mind a critical truth as we return home from yet another disappointing encounter: we aren’t in any way unloveable; we just haven’t found the right love yet.",

      "text": "We can spend a great deal of time – years, perhaps – wondering why certain people, whom we loved very much and who hurt us very deeply, were the way they were and acted as they did.\nThere can be hours in which we wonder: why did they disappear in that way? Why did they never speak up? When it would have been so easy to do X, why did they choose to do Y? Why did they not simply…? Could they not just have…? Wouldn’t it have been at once so much kinder and so much more logical to…? Was the rot there from the beginning, or did it set in later…? What was ever true, and what was a lie?\nThere can be an infinity of angles from which we may approach their harmful and perplexing behaviour. We pore over a timeline of events. We try to chart key moments. We appeal to a formal psychological language in the hope of defining the origins of their immaturities. There are times when we can gain immense relief from unwieldy terms like ‘borderline’ and ‘avoidant,’ ‘dismissive’ and ‘performative.’ We repeatedly inveigle well-meaning – but by now understandably weary – friends into our fevered speculations. On meals and on walks, we hijack the agenda in order to return, once again, to what are in effect fanatical seminars on the elusive, shadowy personalities who wrecked a portion of our lives.\n\nPhoto by Marco Molitor on Unsplash\n\nBut there comes a point, deep in the process, when we may gradually realise that it might be kinder to ourselves to declare defeat once and for all in the face of these ceaselessly tormenting psychological conundrums. Perhaps, despite all the very clever – and at times angry – theories we have marshalled, we will never know quite what drove our person’s odd and damaging behaviour. Was it disguised sadism? Was it plain infidelity? Was it a lie they couldn’t get out of? Was this an echo of their mother’s treatment of them, projected onto the present? Was it a transference from their vain sister or closed-off father? Was their entire personality based on performance and inauthenticity? Were they, to put it colloquially, simply and substantially ‘mad’? Or was it all basically fair enough – an adequate response to our own eccentricities and demands?\nAlongside these questions, another priority comes to mind, more primal and more important: to look after ourselves. Perhaps it doesn’t, in the end, matter. We may conclude after months or years that what was finally up with them will never be known. We are not their therapists or their interpreters. We are not diagnosticians or seers. We are merely, first and foremost, very vulnerable. We are poor things. We can get easily hurt, and we have – here – been devastated by their unpredictability, their mystery and their evasiveness. There is, in the light of this, after yet another seminar, perhaps nothing more that we need to know or think about. These people have not done right by us. They were not ultimately on our side. They caused us entirely unnecessary pain. That is all that we can ultimately know, and all that we ultimately need to keep in mind.\nIt will be for others to work out precisely – if ever – what was ‘wrong’ with them. Maybe nothing much, really, or an immense amount. It’s not for us to keep up the investigations. The answers may come within a decade or two, and we won’t be the central actors anymore. We will, hopefully, have largely forgotten them by then. In the meantime, we have a far greater priority: to bandage our wounds, to care for our sorrows as a kind parent would for those of their frightened child. Enough of the exhausting psychological enquiries. We’ll never know why they were as they were. It’s a matter for the gods. All we know is that we suffered far too much – and that we have had enough. This has gone on for far too long. At this point, the task is more fundamental and more important: to put everything aside in the name of sitting quietly and compassionately with our tender, wounded selves until the ache passes. We know all we need to know already.",

      "text": "Some of us will require the better part of a lifetime to learn a very simple-sounding lesson – one that should have struck us as obvious and urgent from the start: that the only love worthy of the name, the only love we should ever be interested in, is reciprocal love. In other words, a love where another person is entirely convinced of us as we are of them; where another person is every bit as present in the relationship as we are; a love where we never need to persuade or beg; a love where we aren’t left anxious and agitated by evasions and ambiguities; a love where we don’t have to wonder where they are and when they will get back to us; where we aren’t repeatedly up in the early hours writing them messages explaining what we hope for from them; where they never cease to be entirely there for us, as we are there for them – and where they are profoundly grateful that we are in their lives, just as we are grateful that they are in ours.\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Le Lit (&#8216;The Bed&#8217;), c. 1892\n\nThis isn’t arrogance or entitlement. This isn’t ‘too much’. This isn’t ‘neediness’. It’s a basic law of emotional reciprocity that will strike us as peculiar or off-putting for only one reason: because we haven’t yet learned what we are owed; because we have come from a very deprived place; because we were, somewhere early on, trained to despise ourselves.\nWhat nonsense we may accept in lieu of this essential and rightful fare. How many years or decades of life we may have wasted mistaking pain for love. Times when we insisted on imagining that they did love us back, they were just too shy to say so. Times when we sat patiently and politely while they tried to decide whether they should be with us or with a rival, and we felt their dilemma so acutely. Times when we paid for everything and they returned the favour with half-heartedness and forgotten birthday presents.\nWe might have had a marriage behind us in which, almost every evening, we had to fight our case. We had to struggle to have our basic needs acknowledged: that we needed their touch, that we wanted them to be more present, that they couldn’t keep stonewalling us. We might have got involved in all manner of so-called ‘complicated’ relationships – where the person seemed a little loving at first and then very much not so in the long run. But there is never any such thing as a legitimately complicated relationship. They either honour us or they don’t. They are either on the other end of the rope, as firmly as we are, or they don’t belong in our lives in any way.\nLet us keep in mind – always – some fundamental rules that might, because so much went wrong in childhood, be the fruit of decades of inner work:\n— If they are still deciding but haven’t yet (and there are two other people they quite like as well), we must leave them.\n— If they are taking ages to reply to simple messages, we must leave them.\n—  If they are flirting elsewhere, we must leave them.\n— If we need to explain to them why they should want to be with us, we must leave them.\n— If they are wrestling with psychological issues for which we have boundless sympathy but which mean they cannot be kind or present, we must leave them.\n— If they are not infinitely proud of us, we must leave them.\n— If we have given them several good chances and they didn’t listen, we must leave them.\nAnd leave them means exactly that: ensure they are no longer in our lives, that they don’t occupy the slightest space in our cupboards or our thoughts, that there are no more reminders of them anywhere in our consciousness, that we have expelled them like the emotional poisons they are.\nIt is a complicating factor – but no more than that – that we may be married to them, that we have already invested five years in them, that sex is great with them, that we find them beautiful or clever. None of this means anything. None of this is love.\nAll this might escape our notice for a tragic reason: because, for some of us, our childhoods deeply muddled our emotional mechanisms. They gave us the sense that to love is to pine; that to love is to hope to persuade a damaged person (who might initially present as sweet and dependable) that we are good enough. That we are never in the right relationship until we feel ignored, uncomfortable and harshly evaluated. That the only person we really need love from is someone who isn’t wholly persuaded by us.\nWe can’t afford such self-torture and self-abandonment any longer. We need to come down firmly on our own side at last. The self-hatred has gone on long enough. Most people won’t think we’re fabulous – and that’s entirely their right. We simply need to make sure that we don’t ever mistake such types for characters we might love. We need to grow sane enough to allow ourselves to locate, hold on to and tolerate a true ally.\nIt isn’t in any way entitled. It’s not brittle. We deserve to be adored where we adore. Anything less isn’t romantic; it’s self-abandonment. It deserves to be seen for what it is: a legacy of a letdown that we didn’t deserve then and don’t deserve now. We will have understood love when we know that the emotion is in no way about singular self-sacrifice. It’s about two people who feel constantly blessed to have met, who care infinitely for one another. When this finally seems obvious, we’ll be home.",

In case we were to miss it, it’s even etched on the desk - and sounds yet more eloquent in Spanish: El sueño de la razon produce monstruos: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. In other words, as the painter Francisco Goya knew intimately (he’d been manic depressive since late adolescence), night is when things can become unbearable. \n\nWhat each animal really is is a thought, a thought that assails us and is trying to kill us; a thought that is probably an internalisation of the most awful messages we’ve ever heard from other people (probably those we grew up around): you are no good, you disgust me, don’t you dare to outsmart me. The owl with outstretched wings is shrieking: you will never achieve anything. The furry beaked bat is hissing: your desires are revolting. The lynx-like thing at the bottom looks on with judgmentalness: I’m so disappointed in what you’ve become.\n\nDuring the day, when we feel the monsters hovering as we talk to a colleague or give a presentation, we can fend them off with rational arguments: of course we’ve done nothing wrong. There’s no reason to keep apologising, we have the right to be. But at night, we forget all our weapons of self-defence: why are we still alive, why haven’t we given up yet? We don’t know what to answer any more.\n\nTo survive, we need to undertake a lengthy analysis of where each animal came from, what it feeds off, what makes it go on the prowl and how it can be wrestled to submission. One beast might have been born from our father’s mouth, another from our mother’s neglect; most of them love media, too much work, exhaustion, cities and status anxiety. And they hate early nights, nature and the love of friends.\n\nWe need to manage them with all the respect we owe to something that has the power to kill us. We need to build very strong cages out of solid arguments against self-loathing. The monsters will weaken with every piece of calm self-analysis - until the point when, even in the dead of night, as these monsters chafe at their collars and wail as they strike at their bars, we will remember enough about ourselves to be unafraid and to know that we are safe and worthy of love.\n\n\n(For L.B.)"

      "text": "One of the odder features of our psychology is the existence of what we colloquially call our ‘gut instinct’, a faculty that throws up a sense of how things are, that sits to one side of our usual conscious impressions. Our gut may, for example, give us a powerful notion that a particular person is very right for us – or, indeed, that they are distinctly wrong. Our gut may have a view on what job we should be doing, which home we should buy or whether or not we should ask someone a question. What marks out this instinct is precisely that it is an instinct – as opposed to a reasoned proposal whose premises we can explore, probe or explain to someone else. We cannot account for our gut feelings; we don’t know why we feel as we do – we are simply, vaguely yet strongly, certain that we do.\n\nPhoto by Paulius Dragunas on Unsplash\n\nIt can be tempting to dismiss this mute and mysterious point of view. We aren’t used to surrendering to forces we don’t understand and that can’t justify themselves in language. And yet, after a certain amount time on the planet, we may find that we have run into a sufficient number of situations where we ignored our gut instinct, and paid a heavy price for our neglect. After the breakup of a relationship or the end of a business venture, we might, for example, ruefully tell ourselves: ‘I should have trusted my gut …’ A part of us, to which we paid insufficient attention, appears to have known that there was a problem right from the start. Our reason took the upper hand – and we suffered as a result.\nWhat then is this gut instinct? We could define it as a conclusion that flows from an accumulated wisdom that resides in us but isn’t consciously accessible to us. When our gut tells us that someone is ‘wrong’, what’s occurring is that all our knowledge of human beings –built up inside us since birth – is being marshalled in an instant. Under pressure to respond swiftly, it surges into our minds as a distinct perspective. Dozens, even hundreds, of tiny details are noted at lightning speed and processed by a part of our minds to which we have no more access than we do to the part of us that knows how to walk or ride a bicycle or use the pluperfect. It delivers an answer long before our conscious minds – slow, lumbering instruments – are in any position to say why. The gut is a part of our brilliant minds working so fast (normally in response to a pressing need for answers) that we, the conscious part of ourselves, aren’t let into the steps taken to get to a position. The mind is privileging the answer over the route to it. We’re allowing ourselves to be as clever as we are, at the cost of not being able to spell out how we got there.\nIf our gut instinct is often superior to our conscious logic, it is because it seems able to bypass certain biases that lead the latter astray.\nReason is prone to respond naively to other people. It assumes that because someone calls themselves our friend or partner, they will be inherently good. Our gut can keep in mind a more complex and darker truth: there can be betrayal even in intimate situations.\nReason is inclined to be too much on the side of how things should be: that mothers are kind, that children are loyal, that partners don’t steal. It is invested in finding the world as sane and healthy as it wants it to be. The gut has less investment in upholding certain notions of propriety: that one’s own parent might be good, that a friend is trustworthy… The gut is less interested in sunk cost: it doesn’t insist that a certain job is fine just because we’ve spent eight years training for it. The gut can be more appropriately ambitious. It doesn’t need us to be meek or make ourselves small to accommodate the egos of others. It can tell us to follow opportunities that the reasoning parts of us are daunted by.\nThe gut locks onto small cues. It knows that great truths may travel towards us in apparently minor details, that a central fact about someone may be carried in the way their eyes move or what they are doing with their hands. It listens not only to what someone is saying; it’s highly alert also to their posture, their smell, the way they sigh – details that the rational mind is unfairly prone to dismiss as ‘petty’ and an unreliable basis on which to form large judgements. The gut seems primed to notice incongruities. It doesn’t pay attention to large statements (‘I love you …’). It’s alive to almost negligible omissions from the wider story (how long someone is taking to write back, the way they responded when the taxi was delayed …). Most of all, because the gut doesn’t require proof in the ordinary sense, because it doesn’t have to operate with arguments, it can move almost instantly. It can be days, weeks, years ahead of the conscious mind. It’s mining insights we’ve forgotten we even had; it’s drawing on the experience of our entire lives, when reason can keep in view only the tiny amount of data it would be able to pass an exam on. It knows before we know. It just can’t say why.\nPart of our problem with our gut instinct is that it has low prestige as a method of exploration. Schools and universities aren’t interested in it. Serious people seldom speak of it. As a result, we don’t take enough time to listen to it and can end up unsure how even to do so. Accessing it requires a slightly artificial manoeuvre, one that can sound both simplistic and slightly mystical. We need to pause our ordinary activities, still the outer world, and ask ourselves a basic-sounding question: What do I feel is really going on here? What is my gut telling me? And, surprisingly, there will almost always be an answer waiting for us: Leave them. Or: Don’t leave them. Trust or don’t trust. Be patient or you’ve waited long enough. A part of us has already mapped out the path we need to take ahead of the rest of us.\nNone of this is to say that our gut is invariably correct, that it represents an unfailing set of truths. This would be as flawed as privileging our reason exclusively. There are – we need to admit – instances when our gut gets it wrong too (no, they weren’t good for us; no, we shouldn’t have left the relationship; no, the house wasn’t properly built, etc.). It may in the end be as foolish to always listen to our gut as never to listen to it. We should think of it as an auxiliary kind of intelligence which we should more often consult but never entirely trust either. When dilemmas grow especially intense, we should learn to juggle our two brains – the gut and the reasoning faculties – to give ourselves the very best chance of making our way to the complex and elusive truths we need to live by.",

The unfairness is beyond alteration; the corruption, endemic. Some people may win, but they do so within a rigged system. We were not born with those advantages. We never went to those schools. The level of opportunity that has come our way reflects an inherent, non-negotiable set of external factors.\nIt’s a sad perspective – but not without a certain degree of comfort as well. By contrast, what if we were to think that our lack of opportunities, in part, came down to something internal. What if our situation had to do not only with politics and economics, but also – to a crucial extent – with psychology?\n\nPhoto by Joel Mott on Unsplash\n\nPerhaps, whatever the hurdles out there, we are also suffering from a feeling that we don’t deserve more. A feeling that doesn’t take its reference point from anything unchangeable or objective out there, but that relates to something we learned within our family of birth. What if the way we behave reflects a loyalty to a vision of what we believe is right for us to have – a vision that tracks an emotional script we grew up with? What if we have unknowingly come to associate safety with modesty, and danger with triumph? What if we are trying to shield ourselves from our own fabulousness so that we can still have access to a love that we depended on in our early childhood? What if we are trying to be meek, lost and defeated simply to know that we still belong?\nWe have decided that the odds are inherently stacked against us, but we have omitted to notice that we didn’t ask for someone’s number, didn’t send in an application, didn’t push ourselves forward, showed up late for every meeting and then retreated behind the melancholy line: ‘it’s not for me …’\nWe’re not being lazy. We are being inhibited by an emotional tripwire. We have been frightened away from our own power. We have been invisibly educated that to be loveable means remaining small.\nThose who act otherwise – who apply, daydream, hustle – may not have come from a much better place. It’s just that their difficulties pointed them towards a different moral: impress, or I will never notice you. Make a mark, or you won’t count in my eyes. Do something outsize in a hurry or forever surrender any chance of love. These aren’t pleasant strictures, but they may, at least somewhere down the line, enable one to explore their real talents.\nPolitics is dominated by a concern to spread opportunity. The desire is crucial and noble. We need better schools and universities. What this analysis may miss out on is the extent to which the difference between success and failure can – in key cases – have little do with the social system and everything to do with psychology.\nWe should continue to fight for broad, macro-level political improvements, no doubt; but we should also remember to probe at the emotional scripts we follow by asking ourselves three fundamental questions:\n— How frightening would it be to succeed?\n— Who might be upset if I was strong?\n—What threatens to be lost if I stop being submissive and cowed?\nSuccess might have to start with a psychological shift. In the name of what remains of our lives, we may need to stop being loyal to an unfair – perhaps even obscene – demand for meekness that got us through our early years.",

We have a close and supportive relationship. He’s sweet and has always been there for me.’\n\nVincent van Gogh, First Steps, after Millet, 1890\n\nThough we might point to similar advantages in the case of other genders and orientations, this constellation can be worthy of its own particular consideration – not least because what is at stake isn’t just a woman’s bond with the father himself, but with men across her emotional life. A woman wouldn’t – through such a statement – simply be saying that she got on with her dad; she’d be hinting at an above average chance of succeeding at the challenges of adult love.\nA good father may not be able to spare his daughter every kind of suffering; he will, nevertheless, offer her some of the following bounty.\nHe will set a baseline for acceptable treatment. He will define, in his daughter’s mind, what a good man can be. He will equate normality with kindness. Later on, when she meets a sweet-hearted, welcoming, sane suitor, she won’t hold any of his goodness against him. She won’t be tempted to blame him for his interest in her. She won’t think there is something wrong with him because he isn’t cold and doesn’t want to bully her. And likewise, when she meets men who are busy or off-hand, cruel or constantly furious, she won’t feel that she is coming ‘home’, or that there is an inherent rightness to her feelings of danger, invisibility and submission. She won’t confuse brusqueness with intelligence, or callousness with strength. She won’t have the slightest proclivity to being mesmerised by unavailability, or to try out being cruel herself to erase memories of her early victimhood. There will be nothing glamorous whatsoever for her in nastiness. There won’t be any hidden appeal in insensitivity. She will simply be very puzzled that brutes exist and immediately wonder why she might have strayed into their company.\nA good father will have known how to be ordinary. He won’t have used the advantages of age or power or knowledge to impress and grandstand in front of his girl. He will have shown himself to be human, with everything implied by the word: sometimes silly, sometimes ignorant, sometimes sad or confused – not a remote colossus or all-knowing seer. He will have been around often enough to cement an impression of his humdrum yet precious existence. He won’t have made his appearances feel like special occasions. He will have allowed his daughter to take him for granted, week in and week out – so that later on, she wouldn’t have to confuse love with pining, loss or absence. He will have created in his daughter a readiness to accept the limitations and strictures of daily life. She won’t be tempted to dream of gods, faraway princes and remote heroes as alternatives to reality, because she will have known the deeper joys of someone who was present, modest and at peace with himself.\nA good father will, without any need for ideological slogans, have shown his daughter what equality feels like. He will have taught her about the dignity of all genders by asking for her opinions on how to fix a bicycle tire and listening to her remarks about the money supply in her economics paper. He won’t have given her any reason to try to persuade a man who didn’t fully believe in her. She won’t have had to grow to be a people pleaser because she pleased one person who truly mattered.\nA good father won’t have told her she was more special than she was. He won’t have needed her to be his golden child to make up for a deficiency or sense of invisibility in himself. He won’t have needed her in order to counterbalance his own chaos or childishness. A good father won’t have asked her to be any braver or stronger than she wanted to be. He won’t have used her as a target on which to play out his unresolved relationship to his vulnerability. He won’t have been threatened by her interest in either teddy bear picnics or rock climbing, fairy outfits or triathlons. He will have allowed her the privilege of developing at her own pace, according to her inclinations, of never needing to be mature for her years, of being fully a child in her childhood.\nA good father will have walked a hugely careful line around appearance. He will have made his daughter feel that he had noticed her and endowed her with a calm, unflustered sense of her power. He will have spared her any aspiration to charm a random multitude to compensate for the injury of having been ignored by one person in particular. At the same time, a good father will always have respected her privacy; he won’t have called her his special little princess, told her to keep secrets or dropped hints about his unhappiness with mummy. He won’t have given her any sense that he might forget about boundaries, burdening her with an unfair need to police them herself by toning down her exuberance or her charm. He will have allowed her to enjoy her full adult sexuality without fear.\nWith the help of such a list, some of the toll of poor fathering comes more clearly into view. Fathers who can’t resist ensuring they are outsize heroes. Fathers whose hugs are too tight. Fathers whose attentions are forever elsewhere – with work, a sibling or military history – so that their daughters must ask themselves implicitly throughout their lives: ‘What might be wrong with me? Why can’t I be good enough?’ Fathers who will one day be the cause of an entirely unnecessary bill being paid to a plastic surgeon. Fathers who set up an equation between love and suffering, love and unkindness, love and absence.\nGood fathers lead to daughters who won’t need to plead or beg, who get no pleasure from being ignored, who are not overly preoccupied with their appearance or status, who never refuse love nor randomly blow up tender relationships for reasons they can barely understand.\nWhenever we encounter sickly love, we know that the story did not begin there. And equally, whenever there is tolerance and happiness, an ability to give and to receive affection, we know there will have been crucial antecedents at play. Somewhere offstage, there will be a largely unheralded hero who facilitated a path towards maturity and contentment. Many a man who has found himself loved reliably by a good, steady and sane woman will – unbeknownst to him – have had another older, perhaps now-dead, man to thank for his momentous blessings.",

      "text": "At first blush, it’s a little confusing why online dating should attract so many cries of protest and rage. Why is this medium the site of so much agony when – on paper – it should simply present us with a broad array of possibilities for love?\n\nFrancisco Goya, Dance of the Majos at the Banks of Manzanares, 1777\n\nThe bad reputation isn’t unearned; it is indeed a very painful area. But there are two clear causes for the trouble, and two identifiable remedies.\nThe first cause is naive or sentimental hope. A section of the online population constantly finds themselves connecting with characters they are immediately extremely enthusiastic about – people they would love to build a relationship with, but whom they then gradually discover are not as interested in them as they should be.\nApparently, these characters are very busy at the office, their phone fell out of the train, they’re off to Italy for ten days, their best friend had an operation on their big toe, they have to travel to another city to buy an extension for their garden hose&#8230; They may eventually meet up for a coffee, they may be very smiley during the occasion, but there will then be further, enervating ambiguity as to whether, like an elusive deity, they will ever deign to make another earthly appearance.\nAll this is admittedly ghastly but, with immense sympathy, let’s offer a sober interpretation: the suitor is, to an important degree, bringing this on themselves. And they are doing so by being excessively sentimental. They are seeing signs – very clear signs – and are opting to ignore them. They are not being honest about what they are up against because they are scared; scared of another negative verdict, scared of isolation, scared of the damage to their self-esteem that every rejection brings, scared of dying alone. These are extremely honourable fears, which deserve all our compassion. What we should never do is avoid them.\nAt the very first sign of disinterest – the very first moment when the target of our desire doesn&#8217;t answer our messages or speaks vaguely of an intention to contact us ‘after their best friend’s cousin’s wedding in Finland…’ – we should, with greater self-protection, sit with ourselves and reckon with the dark truth head-on: they don’t like us very much. They may like us a little bit – enough to meet us for a walk or a museum visit. We’re not repulsive to them. But, crucially, not enough to love us. Not enough for us to bother a moment longer. This isn’t how true love ever begins. These people aren’t shy; they aren’t touchingly inarticulate. They are not properly interested – not to the degree that they need to be for a relationship to have any chance of working. True love knocks down the door to make itself heard, and our door is resolutely untouched. Someone delighted by us smiles all the time, asks us one question after another and messages us at once. They may not have time, but they find it. They are thrilled by us; they can’t wait to see us again. We must therefore cut the waverers out of our hopes with a surgeon’s sanguinity. There isn’t a second to waste. We should let out a cathartic scream, cry very briefly – and then continue on our odyssey. Anything less is an insult to our vulnerability.\nThen there is another cause. If one section of the online population is woefully sentimental, another is woefully vain. They cannot admit that many of the people they have casually signalled an interest in aren’t, in fact, remotely characters they’d consider dating if they had better options. Unfortunately, they have only the promise of better options – this is the overriding principle of the online world – but no concrete prospects right now. So they do the obvious, vain and self-serving thing: hang onto their B-list targets without any real intention of responding to their hopes, keeping them close but never too close, just in case; half in and out of the warmth, suspended between life and death, to allay their anxieties about their own futures.\nIt’s only in the digital age that we can afford to be so irresponsible; to wink pleasantly at so many people we don’t really like; that we can acquire a pool of Category B suitors to cheer us up when the A pool runs momentarily dry. In the old world, the price of any seduction was extremely high. It took a long time to win someone over, it demanded a lot of money, one had to buy flowers and go to many elaborate balls. People would growl if they saw us spread our attentions too thinly. So we concentrated only on the ones that really, really mattered.\nNow we flirt while lying in the bath or waiting for the bus. We signal interest in a hundred people without ever raising our heartbeat – nodding at a vast array of passersby without taking the slightest responsibility for the emotional chaos that is unleashed.\nThere would be peace if both sides (and it may, ironically, be the very same people who are guilty of both behaviours) took on board two awkward facts: firstly, that there aren’t so many people they really, really like – and secondly, that there aren’t so many people who really, really like them back. In the intervening period, while waiting for a proper resolution to the emotional chasm, rather than pretending to like where they don&#8217;t like and hoping where there is no hope, both sides should relent: the suitors should accept that they are being toyed with, and the pursued should stop smiling at anyone other than those whom they are profoundly convinced by.\nThere would – if these two rules were obeyed – be a lot less reason to keep looking at our phones (which is why the industry is so careful to stay silent). The wait for reciprocal affection would be far longer and a great deal more uneventful, but we would be a great deal more likely not to suffer so intensely, to be able to hold on to our dignity, to exercise more, and to read some good books in bed. We would, every day, walk a far less humiliating route to the love we so badly want – and, at this point, so richly deserve.",

      "text": "The very sizeable piece of cosmic real estate we call the universe does not – at first glance – seem especially hospitable to, or concerned with, anything remotely connected to human beings. None of its two trillion galaxies, each containing up to a thousand billion stars, seems able to support life. Its rotations and expansions proceed without the slightest reference to human time or measure. Tonight’s dinner and the broken bathroom tap must seem like very small things indeed from the perspective of our nearest stellar neighbour, Proxima Centauri – 4.2 light years away – steadily burning through its four-trillion-year lifespan.\n\nThe heart of NGC 1097, a barred spiral galaxy that lies about 48 million light-years from Earth. ESA / Hubble &amp; NASA, D. Sand, K. Sheth\n\nNevertheless, some of us are prone, when puzzling or painful events befall us, to deploy an unusual-sounding term. In relation to our reversals, we may whisper to ourselves: ‘The universe is teaching me a lesson.’ When a friend is in tears, we may respond gently: ‘The universe perhaps had another plan for you…’ And we might account for yet another delay to our hopes by saying: ‘The universe is calling for me to be more patient.’\nWhen we speak like this, we are no longer conceiving of the universe as a vast, implacable system governed solely by the laws of astrophysics. It becomes a far more intimate, beneficent force, intensely connected to our destinies – a force that wants us to grow and, most importantly, to learn; to accede to our better selves, to understand who we really are and to accept a necessary role for pain and mystery within a broadly good, fruitful and eventually comprehensible account of our lives.\nThe universe may not – perhaps – give a jot about us. And yet, to speak in poetic or metaphorical terms as if it might can be classified as the height of therapeutic wisdom. Doing so trains our minds to search always for a submerged upside to appalling or puzzling situations, and to develop the will to discern pieces of psychological instruction in what might otherwise simply be a ghastly, undesired mess.\nWe receive a threatening medical diagnosis: the universe is trying to teach us to focus on what we really want from our work while there is still time. An adored partner leaves us for someone else: we’re being taught, we eventually conclude, to develop a less anxious style of attachment so that we can be more reassuring to our next lover.\nThis ideology accepts that we may not always know what the universe’s lesson for us might be; we’re simply encouraged to believe that there is likely to be one. Why did we fail to make friends? We can’t say yet, but the universe will yield an explanation in time. Why did the person we went on a date with disappear so suddenly after a promising start? We don’t know yet, but the universe will have had some idea in mind. Why are we passing through such a troubled and frightened period? The universe is a giant classroom, and it is for us – its humble students – to trust in, and remain steady in the face of, its ongoing educational mission.\nWe must – along the way – accept an implicit bargain: the universe has no alternative but to teach many of its lessons through pain. Lovers abandon us, plans fall through, enemies attack us. The universe wills us not to panic or despair. Why is everyone turning us down? Why is no one calling? Why does no one seem to care? Why didn’t she answer? Where is he? We may not know precisely. Yet, we can trust that – with time – some form of redemptive learning, however raw or austere, will emerge.\nIn our way of framing matters, we are – at one level – at risk of being far too modest about what we’re up to. It’s not, of course, the universe that reveals meaning. It’s our own brilliant and resilient minds that process, reframe and interpret the difficulties we face. We are the ones arduously teasing out moral instructions, reminding ourselves not to despair and forging consoling summaries, not the resolutely mute galaxy Messier 87 in the Virgo Cluster or the equally obtuse Centaurus A in the constellation Centaurus. And yet how clever of us to deftly attribute our compassionate efforts to a mightier and nobler entity, into whom we can project some of the confidence we too often unfairly fail to muster for ourselves. We speak great truths, and then have the canniness to put them into the mouth of the mightiest, most awe-inspiring force we know – so as to be able to benefit from them as fully and as effectively as we deserve.",

      "text": "When we have been the victims of treachery or adultery in love, the loss is not just of the person we once adored but of a broader capacity to trust human beings going forward.\nWe think: if we missed the signs here, we will miss them everywhere. If they declared that they would be loyal and faithful to us until the end, if they looked up at us with doe eyes and called us their precious one, and then began drifting away, flirting with others online and staying out too late at parties, how can we ever recover our faith in anyone?\n\nPhoto by Alex Ivashenko on Unsplash\n\nWe need a strategy to allow us to rebuild a future.\n1. Self-forgiveness\nWe didn’t miss the betrayal because of any gross personal deficiency. Our suffering is the result of emotional maturity. This is what may legitimately happen when we have learnt what many people will never master: how to love someone wholeheartedly. We were let down because we overcame our fear of intimacy, because we finally acquired the art of relaxing our defences, of being grown up enough to cry in someone else’s company, of believing in tenderness and loyalty and of perceiving the innocent and wounded child inside an adult partner. We were not foolish; we were doing what true, evolved love asks of us.\n2. We must not generalise\nThe problem, when we are in despair, lies in our temptation to generalise. In pain, we lose the power to discriminate. We cry out simply: everyone is awful, everyone is a traitor. It is highly understandable. But it is also a form of catastrophic exaggeration that doesn’t reflect reality – and that we can ill afford.\nWe need to get more precise. There were specific reasons why this person betrayed us and – rather than sighing cosmically – we need to become fast experts in what these might have been.\nMany people are treacherous, but many more are not. And those who are tend to have certain defined characteristics, which can be identified, isolated and absorbed so that we can detect them more readily and more accurately next time around. For example:\n— A resistance to conflict and evasiveness. The great betrayers tend to be those who cannot bear confrontation. It sounds almost sweet (close to shyness and modesty), but the results are anything but. To what extent can a partner break difficult news? Can they find their tongue when it’s needed? This tends to require some questions about their childhood. Were they the cowed, quiet and ‘good’ child because father was raging and mother was dismissive? (The great liars tend to have had very angry parents.) Did they develop their own personality, or were they chiefly made to facilitate those of others? We should learn to be vigilant around people-pleasers who, in terror of upsetting us, might destroy years of our lives.\n— To what extent does a partner like themselves? Those who hate themselves are at far greater risk of disbelieving in your love, and of destroying it when it starts to threaten the isolation on which they have learnt to depend for their sense of safety.\n— How awful was their childhood and how well do they know it? It’s hugely attractive to try to fix someone’s wounds. But we should be highly aware of the risks of trying to do so. Maybe we should learn to leave our ambulance at home on the next date. An underloved child doesn’t grow cleanly and simply into a grateful and predictable adult. They develop into someone who thinks they want love and then is highly likely to become overwhelmed and engulfed when it arrives. They will swerve and sadistically punish anyone who does, in fact, try to love them, giving them a direct sense of how badly they were treated.\n— How good are they at expressing anger? Betrayal is frequently a form of rage that hasn’t found a more direct way to emerge. When they are disappointed, are they able to let you know in good time? Are they able to tell themselves – let alone you – when something is wrong?\n— Do they go cold in bed without knowing how to account for their withdrawal? Do they flirt with other people and then apologise, without seeming to know why they behaved as they did? Sex tends to be the bellwether and leading indicator of trouble.\n— We should be on the lookout for honesty around minor letdowns. Can they admit to making a stain on the bedroom floor or inadvertently scratching your desk? Or was it always a mystery or someone else’s fault? How much can they cleanly declare that they forgot to get dinner, blocked the drains or got too interested in a film to remember to do the garden? Can they take ownership of their actions and feelings? The full structure of a betrayal is almost always already present in the handling of so-called details.\n3. We must be vigilant\nWe tend to create a false dichotomy: either we trust, or we are vigilant. But there are ways to love someone while always keeping one eye open for disaster.\nIt is entirely possible to enjoy immense peace and cosiness while also – as it were – remembering where the exits are. Flight crews do it all the time. We can be thrilled at someone’s kind gestures and warm words and know that these might still not be wholly solid. We can be hugely optimistic – and yet know that nothing is ever entirely certain. And that’s OK for a human being.\n4. We know we will survive\nThe greatest lesson we can take from a breach of trust is the knowledge that we can, in fact, whatever it may feel like on dark days, overcome any breach of trust. It won’t be pleasant, we may weep for many weeks, but we will solidify, grow stronger and eventually go on. Summer will return.\nThis makes complete trust less important than it might seem to someone who has never gone through a betrayal. The betrayed may paradoxically – if they interpret the event correctly – eventually come to place less emphasis on total trust, and become more sanguine about its lapses.\nOf course, we want to believe that our new partner (who has already said some very encouraging and beautiful things) will be kinder and more solid than the last. The signs are good – we might be planning the holidays and have talked about what it would be like to share a home. But we won’t know the full state of play for a while, and it is no proof of undue cynicism to say so. We can believe them, admire them and even love them quite a lot – and yet know, as life has shown us already, that we can get it very wrong. And survive.",

      "text": "We tend to assume that good relationships are fundamentally founded on the values and attributes of the people we get together with. But we might venture that long before there is anyone else on the scene, before we even enter the dating world, what truly determines our chances of a sound romantic future lies elsewhere: in the quality of the relationship we have with ourselves. \nWhat exactly do we mean by this strange term, a relationship with ourselves? Essentially, it refers to the sense we carry of what we deserve, based on who we feel we are. \n\nEthel Leontine Gabain, At a Sunny Window, 1883–1950, Watford Museum\n\nSome of us grow up with the ability to be instinctively and profoundly kind to ourselves. Without smugness or conceit, we know that we merit good treatment, that we are decent people, that we have things to offer – and that it would not be appropriate for anyone to make us suffer or to humiliate us. In other words, we are on our own side. In the way we view ourselves, we carry the attitude of every sane parent towards the child they love: we believe that we are good enough.\nBut some of us are not so blessed. For as long as we can remember, we may simply have despised our own being. We have no love for our bodies or our minds; we assume that everyone we encounter would have good reason to think rather ill of us. If we were asked to rate our character out of ten, it would feel intuitively logical to award ourselves a zero or a one. Are we worth knowing? Not really. Are we attractive? Of course not. Are we repugnant? Yes, in a hard-to-pin-down but incontestable way, of course.\nFor a long time, we may not make much of a connection between this background relationship with ourselves and what goes on in our love lives. The two issues can seem utterly unrelated: one has to do with self-esteem, the other with the sort of people we fall in love with. But under examination, this relationship to self reveals itself as the explanatory factor in almost everything that unfolds romantically. What occurs with our partners from adolescence onward – who we choose or don’t choose, how long things last or don’t last – is, in the end, nothing more nor less than a consequence of, and an extrapolation from, the view we hold of ourselves.\nWhen people with a good relationship with themselves face a prospective lover, they instinctively have one question in mind: whether or not this individual has their interests at heart. Are they going to be kind? Do they know how to be tender? Do they make them feel safe? Are they properly delighted to be in their presence? Without anything arrogant being meant by this, do they understand how lucky they are to be with them? It is this – not some random physical or social attribute – that ends up determining how ‘attractive’ they seem. ‘Sexiness’, in the healthy mind, is merely an offshoot of niceness. \nAs the union deepens, self-loving people signal that good treatment is the non-negotiable condition of remaining in their company. And, on this basis, good treatment tends to be precisely what they receive – because, in a poignant dynamic, other people generally treat us according to how we unconsciously signal that we deserve to be treated. \nFor the person who likes themselves, their partner has to be reliable, they have to be polite, they must hold themselves accountable. They can’t take an age replying to messages. They aren’t allowed to lie or flirt with other people. And so, typically, they don’t. At any sign of trouble, the self-loving person will speak up (it’s easy for them to do so when they aren’t ashamed of who they are): Why were you out so late? Is it right to be drinking so much? Couldn’t you have messaged me? There isn’t any hesitation about getting stern when a boundary has been crossed; but nor are there grounds for anger, which only tends to be born out of self-hating panic that one has no alternatives.\nHow woeful, by contrast, is the fate of the person with a sickly relationship to themselves. They have no memory of being treated well and so have no model of how to protect their interests when these come under threat. They may stamp their feet or scream, but they are powerless. If someone starts to treat them poorly, it feels familiar rather than shocking. If the partner makes excuses, they double down on silently hoping that there can be change with even greater effort. Nastiness is read as sexiness. The more unpredictable and poor the love they receive, the more they trust in its existence. If they get rejected, they spend years longing (or begging) to get back into the very relationship that devastated them. \nAnyone can fall in with a scoundrel: the difference between people of low and high self-esteem is how long they choose to remain in their company. \nThe origins of our relationship with ourselves are – tragically – only an internalisation of the very first relationship we had in childhood. It’s the kind of care we received as infants that creates the model for how we treat ourselves. The chief sign of an unloving childhood is an inability to protect our interests. Those who’ve been neglected once will end up being neglected again – indeed, will end up being magnetically attracted to neglect, which will feel like love; which will feel like home.\nFor those of us who may now have a dawning sense that not all is well in how we treat ourselves, we might start by asking some momentous yet simple sounding questions: Is it right that I suffer at another’s hands? Should I be pining for someone who doesn’t want to know me? And, correspondingly, should I always be suspicious of someone who is that very unfamiliar thing: nice? Eventually, what should have been obvious from the beginning will at last be absorbed as a native truth: there is no reason for a partner to be anything other than kind.",

      "text": "When life inside a couple has grown full of strife, when argument follows argument, when both people are hurting and being hurt, what more natural response is there than to conclude that it is time – sadly but necessarily – to get out? Love isn’t meant to be like this. This degree of conflict and misery can’t be normal or right. Friends agree. Other suitors beckon. The digital world seems rife with possibilities. There have to be alternatives. It’s a planet of eight billion; there have to be easier solutions. We ache for calm. We wake up in a frenzy. It’s time to get out.\nOr is it? The feeling may be incontestable; its legitimacy may be a great deal less so. For when we properly assess the situation – when we step back and consider matters from the perspective of a lifetime, or of the human race as a whole – then it becomes far less clear that getting out summarily is the sole or best answer.\n\nPhoto by Yevhenii Dubrovskyi on Unsplash\n\nIn fact, a whole raft of evidence suggests that – despite the pain – we would be advised to take it very slowly indeed, to step right back from the precipice, and to develop the courage for another go.\nThe reasons are multiple:\n— Because it is not, whatever it may seem, likely to be simply better out there.\n— Because any alternative human we might find will bring with them a raft of fresh and immense complexities. No one is ever normal – we just know them less well.\n— Because we are hugely peculiar ourselves; because we need to remember – very modestly – how much trouble we are bringing into the situation; because it is not all their fault; because (whatever our therapist or best friend thinks) there are two forgivably mad people here, not just one.\n— Because we have already achieved so much with this person that we are now omitting to keep in mind. We have been in love with them. We find them attractive. We have laughed deeply together. We hate the same people. We are neglecting to fathom the stunning rarity of this. They’ve seen us at our lowest ebb. They took us to hospital; we nursed them through multiple illnesses. We tolerated extraordinary shenanigans from them. We’re on their side. We danced in the kitchen. We have years behind us. We gave them nicknames and a teddy bear. We built a world together.\n— Because we have already worked so hard at understanding them – and they, us. Perhaps we’ve had some therapy; we’ve read some books; we’ve got some bits of the map of our psyches under control. We know that they’re a bit this because of their mother, and we, a bit that because of our father. This sort of knowledge didn’t come easily. It took months, perhaps years, to achieve this level of psychological fluency. Maybe we’re only a third of the way through, and the missing two-thirds is weighing heavily on us right now. But let’s not overlook how much we already know. What sorrow it would be to tip the whole structure into the sea, to get rid of all the hours of conversation, the learnings from a thousand arguments, and to stand afresh with a new person back at zero across a dinner table. We must be sure –cosmically sure – that this is the only option before we destroy an entire library of love.\nNone of us have been here enough times before to know the wisdom, or otherwise, of burning the structure down. But let’s not minimise our good fortune to have run into this – admittedly tricky but in essence wondrous – being. They were a gift, and we knew it before the pain set in. We aren’t silly; we didn’t fall in love for no reason. Most people we meet bore us after a minute, and would revolt us naked. We’ve managed years with them. This is everything.\nWe’re complaining and wanting to run because we assume that fighting and misery are abnormal, but only because we’ve been insufficiently exposed to genuine normality. What’s truly abnormal is to care about someone as much as we have cared for them. Of course they are mad, but we are too. And so is every human we will ever alight upon.\nLet’s acknowledge the agonies in a full-throated way. They are an unparalleled nightmare. They have horrendous childhood wounds. They’re anxious or avoidant – and any number of other pathologies. One could fairly stick more or less an entire psychological diagnostic manual to them.\nBut perhaps it feels so bad now because – strangely – we’re getting ever closer to something real. The increased fighting isn’t an indication of incompatibility, but of the increased risk and tension that comes as we prepare to properly allow someone into our lives. The arguments may not be dysfunction so much as defences crumbling. This may be the terror of two people who’ve been schooled all their lives to be alone, preparing – finally – to unmask themselves.\nThere is so much anger and suspicion on both sides. We’ll need to swallow our pride, accept things we swore we’d never countenance, admit to vulnerabilities we’ve been in flight from since the start.\nBut – perhaps – we should do it. In a deeply imperfect world, this is something remarkable. Let&#8217;s head back inside. Let&#8217;s stick at it.",

      "text": "There’s a widespread understanding of – and sympathy for – people’s desire to change their social class. What is less well understood is that, to the side of this, there are often very powerful instincts in us to gain access to specific and more localised ‘tribes’.\nBeneath the three large, familiar economic classes, we can speak of multiple groupings bound together by interests, proclivities and values, to which we can lend the term tribes. For example, in any given society, we might identify some of the following: the tribe of sporty people who go fell-walking and weightlifting and are interested in vitamin supplements and lycra; the tribe of the posh country set, who might be called Rupert and Serena, and who enjoy horse racing and skiing; the tribe of the intellectuals, who read Nietzsche and Lacan and discuss articles in The New York Review of Books and N+1; the tribe of the communists and the vegans, the allotment growers and the environmentalists; the arty crowd and the music crowd; the fashion crowd and the video games tribe. And so on.\n\nPhoto by Thomas Benedetti on Pexels\n\nOne of the relative mysteries in all this is what drives people’s aspirations to join a specific tribe. It’s simple enough to see why one might want more money, but why do some people, in addition, want so deeply to belong to one tribe rather than another? And, in particular, what drives a longing to shift away from the tribe of one’s origins?\nOne interpretation is that we seek to change tribes as a defence against the deprivations and sufferings we experienced in the tribes of our childhoods. People often seek to move tribes when their early years denied them the attuned that care every child longs for – when mother (who might have been a tribal aristocrat or a socialist, a mountain climber or scientist) lacked warmth, and father (who might have belonged to the liberal politics tribe or the deep-sea diving tribe) was oppressive or violent, always busy or keener on a sibling. To try to shift tribes is a response to a lack of love – and an expression of a longing finally to belong. In such cases, people don’t only want to move away from their parents, they’re also trying to move away from their parents’ worlds and values. They interpret a shift in tribe as a way of compensating for the emotional care they were denied and of seeking revenge on a brutal, chaotic or neglectful past. There can be real redemption – and quite a bit of fun – to be had in upsetting a parent by one day being able to wave around the signs of membership of a new tribe they would be appalled by.&nbsp;\nWe can imagine no end of moves across tribes that obey such a pattern. Let’s picture – for example – a woman, let’s call her Arabella, who grows up in a Catholic aristocratic tribe in rural England, and who then – after university – decides to go to Varanasi in India, throws away her demure clothes and faith and studies under Swami Ananda Giri, seeking in her new tribe a corrective to the snobbery and coldness of her early years. Her parents, Lord and Lady R., might be gratifyingly horrified.\nOr imagine Peter, who grows up with highly intellectual parents (both might have PhD’s) from an academic tribe. But they might seem lost, unable to take care of themselves, and lacking practical ability and groundedness. So when he grows up, Peter might want to join the tribe of the manual workers: the carpenters and boat builders, people who stay close to elementally nourishing and essential things, and who might go sailing on the weekend and camping on holiday.\nContrast this with another young person, Roisin, who grows up on a hard housing estate as the child of highly ideological left-wing parents. There are gangs and knifings outside the home, and inside, the atmosphere is brittle and joyless; one is meant to take pride in deprivation and see virtue in having no space and no money. When she finishes her studies, what Roisin yearns for more than anything is to join a so-called respectable middle class right-wing tribe, in which people are lawyers and bankers who throw dinner parties at which the talk is of share prices and private schools.\nIn all these very different scenarios, the tribe emerges as a fantasised solution to the emotional deprivations of childhood. The tribe of origin might not have been a problem if there had been love; but as there wasn’t, the dream is that a new tribe – the high church tribe or the techno ravers, the anarchists or the houseboat dwellers – will appease the yearning, isolation and sadness.&nbsp;\nOften, the tribal shift doesn’t quite work. The Indian guru doesn’t solve the pain; nor do the raves or the dinner parties. The parents don’t care, or their hurt doesn’t offer much long-term recompense. In time (it may swallow a decade or more), one realises that the new tribe can’t fix things – because it was never really the tribe of origin that wounded one: it was only really the particular attitudes and behaviours of the parents where the problem lay, and where the mourning and focus need to take place.\nUnderstanding the dynamics of one’s tribal yearnings in this more psychological way may save us valuable time. It can spare us the need to waste years chasing a tribe that wouldn’t properly solve our distress even if we gained access to it. It can leave us free to choose romantic partners without reference to tribal restrictions. It can allow us to mourn the parental love that was not given to us – and then go on to forge a more independent and more original, less hidebound and less provincial, way of living.",

      "text": "It sounds, on the surface, like the most withholding and mean-minded of strategies: to go very slowly when we might, at some level, want to go very fast indeed. To say, ‘perhaps we might meet again in a couple of weeks,’ rather than ‘are you free tomorrow?’; to let at least four meetings pass before we hold out a hand; to assume that we can’t, for a long while, really know who has come into our lives – and so not to introduce them to friends, not to get into a regular rhythm over text and not to mention love until it’s almost a different season.\nSuch self-possession might sound denying and sad. Why such miserliness? Modernity was supposed to have liberated us from decorum. We were supposed to have let go of the rigmaroles of propriety for the untrammelled callings of our hearts.\nBut slowness does not necessarily have anything to do with prudishness or social mores; it can be where we land once we’ve built up a more profound understanding of the psychology of love. Whatever we may tell ourselves, love is far from being simply all we humans want. However heady and beautiful it might appear from a distance, it is something that may ­– in actuality – terrify us as much as it delights us; something we’re as much tempted to flee as to embrace.\n\nPhoto by Florian van Schreven on Unsplash\n\nCaution is therefore logical. To stand helpless and vulnerable before another human, to hope that they will see us as we are and still care for us, opens us up to a genuine and uncommon risk of devastation. If heartbreak can kill us (and it more or less can), no wonder if we should – at least in part ­– begin with modest steps.\nTo the general terror, some of us have backgrounds that add another particularly intense layer of fear. We may have grown up in disturbed environments where the first rule of love was that it was scarce and unpredictably distributed. In our youngest years, we may have had to acclimatise ourselves to a very uneven supply of affection. Perhaps Mother was unavailable and Father was violent. There might have been a lot of sarcasm and not much patience for our sorrows or opinions. And therefore, the only way to survive would have been to withdraw, to learn to play alone – and to make our peace with a restricted emotional diet.\nSo when someone arrives in adulthood promising us a banquet – when someone lays out dish after dish of generosity and care, when someone promises us unlimited kindness and tenderness – our first response may not be joy but nausea; not delight but panic. We may be unable to absorb or metabolise any of the rich nutrients before us and, without quite knowing why, in order to maintain our poise, may have no option but to turn on our kind hosts, blame them for being weak or odd &nbsp;– and run away. We might wish to tell them: please be so kind as not to be too kind. Please be generous enough not to overwhelm me. Please let me find my own way to reciprocation.\nOn the other side of the ledger, we – the so-called generous ones, the banquet-givers who like to move fast – should also be brave enough to question our behaviour. It may look as if we’re being purely and simply ‘romantic’ (Paris on the second date! Nicknames after a week!), but we may turn out to be – beneath our bold gestures – &nbsp;something rather more complicated and sad: untenably and unhelpfully anxious. We lose our minds if we haven’t heard from them in two hours. We can’t bear not to know their intentions before the arrival of desert. We are giving a lot not so much because we want to, but because we have no confidence in ourselves as people with a solid claim to affection. We are running to stay one step ahead of self-disgust. We are moving at lightning speed because our childhoods have taught us that love may disappear at any time, that nothing is solid, that we aren’t worthy, and that the best way to prevent loss is to make outsized efforts, to lose ourselves in displays of devotion, and to prompt our beloved to say ‘yes’ before either of us know who the other might be.\nMature love, by contrast, sits – boringly but beautifully – in a middle zone between frightened rush on the one hand and equally frightened withholding on the other. Its hallmarks are confidence, calm and self-possession. Its essence is patience. The healthy lover has the wherewithal to think: I like them, but I don’t yet know them. I want them to stay around, but I could bear to live without them. I’m attracted to them, but I have no need to act on my desires. There will be time…\nIt may sound clever, but it’s in truth usually something far more automatic and instinctive: the legacy of a reliable loving upbringing. For those of us who haven’t benefited from such a gift (and there is no greater), we can nevertheless make a conscious effort to slow down our trepidations and our extravagances. Our attitudes to love can gradually become imbued with ease, serenity and self-compassion. We can grow more certain that we will find someone, here or elsewhere, because we have much to offer. We can survive rejection. We can afford to delay and explore. We can take as much time as we need, paying constant and close attention to how comfortable we feel, avoiding any embarrassment at being uncertain by communicating our hesitations honestly – so that eventually, one day, when it finally feels right, we can take a thoughtful risk and reach out for their hand, knowing that we will be able to survive whatever follows.",

      "text": "After a painful two-year absence, the most beautiful woman in London is finally back home, on the upper floor of the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery of Art. She rarely attracts much attention, for she subscribes to none of the canons of modern beauty. She would be entirely overlooked by the arbiters of contemporary taste and yet, to those with eyes ready to meet her, she belongs incontestably among the most beguiling and significant humans ever to have found form.\n\nRogier van der Weyden, The Magdalene Reading, c. 1430s\n\nRogier van der Weyden’s The Magdalene Reading (completed in Bruges in the early 1430s) merits our interest on multiple grounds:\n— She is beautiful because she is so deeply serious. Modern tastes incline towards happiness. To be pretty is to be smiling – perhaps surfing, too. The old Christian painters understood a more important lesson: life is a tragedy. It all ends in Calvary, in a bloodbath, and so the most dignified attitude to bear on one’s journey through existence must be one of intense, dignified solemnity. Of course, one can smile – at a child playing, at a dog running across a field, at a joke between old friends – but this is joy rendered profound and bittersweet by a continuous awareness of a background of loss and grief.\n— She is beautiful because, in her sorrows, she is ready to meet you in your depths. There is no need for superficial pleasantries with her. One wouldn’t have to claim that everything was going well. There would be no point in grandstanding. She would see through the veil and ‘know’ that you (like her) cry a lot, that you’re carrying so much pain, that you are always worried, that you are profoundly lonely, that so few people understand, that there have been so many mistakes. And she would know this of you because she would know it of – and accept it in – herself. She would hold out a hand to you as a fellow ailing sibling and whisper very gently and simply: I know&#8230;\n— She is beautiful because she doesn’t ask you for perfection. You can be broken around her, and she around you. She has taken to heart the fundamentally consoling idea at the heart of Christianity: that we are all sinners. Which shouldn’t be a remotely depressing thought. It’s what allows us to cast off modernity’s punishing ideals of accomplishment and power. In her religion, there are a few perfect beings at large; they are very much up in the sky. Down here on earth, we’re all mortals – no king or minister can come anywhere close to the grace of an angel, let alone the majesty of the King of Kings, Holy of Holies. We’re all stumbling around, trying to do our best, making mistakes, getting it wrong. And from our acceptance of our mutual imperfection flow friendship, forgiveness and tenderness.\n— She is beautiful because she knows how to quietly read a book. She doesn’t need to look at who has just posted what and where. She can keep her own anxieties at bay long enough to enlarge her horizons through the ideas of others. She only occasionally looks up to take in the view or the sound coming from the kitchen. She has time for her thoughts – and therefore, in turn, she will know how to make time for yours.\n— She is beautiful because she isn’t remotely thinking about how beautiful she might be. She is interested in her work, her responsibilities, the sacraments, the ways to a good life. She would – fortunately – think us very silly for paying her so much attention.\nThe French writer Stendhal wrote that ‘beauty is the promise of happiness.’ A beautiful face isn’t, according to this view, just a visual phenomenon; it’s an indicator of the sort of life one might have around someone. Which, in the Magdalene’s case, might mean a life of depth, kindness, gentleness and calm: a way back to our true home.\nThis woman isn’t an ideal in any remote, punishing sense. She’s no goddess or paragon of purity (according to some accounts, her past was complex). Her dress might be hard to find; her attitude is far more available. She’s a goad to recover contact with all that is serious, settled and kind in us – and those we connect with. She is – as her painter surely hoped she could be – one of our closest friends, waiting for us across the centuries.",

      "text": "One of the most distressing eventualities in romantic life occurs when an anxiously attached partner and an avoidantly attached one end up – without in any way meaning to, and while there is still a lot of goodwill in the air – generating an unbounded vortex of panic and fear that neither of them understands and from which they cannot pull themselves out before matters collapse in a state of fateful hurt and distrust. Years after the event, after a few more failed relationships, one or both partners may be liable to look back with complete puzzlement (and some regret) on the chaotic episode and wonder how things could ever have spiralled so badly. This is one kind of explanation.\n\nPhoto by Daniil Korbut on Unsplash\n\nBoth anxiously and avoidantly attached people carry a distinctive and exaggerated core fear – typically the result of an unattuned and neglectful childhood – and a hugely unhelpful and outsized response to this fear. For the anxious person, the fear is: ‘I’m going to be abandoned, and I won’t be able to survive the loss in any way. My entire being depends on the person I love.’ And the accompanying response belief is: ‘I must therefore cling, protest and argue until the end in order to avoid losing my adored person.’\nFor their part, the avoidant person’s core fear is: ‘Other people can’t be relied upon. They hurt you, betray you, blow hot and cold, and don&#8217;t have your true interests at heart.’ And their response to this deep fear is: ‘I must therefore put up enormous barriers, say nothing, and disappear – or else I will be overwhelmed and engulfed. I am never really secure until I am alone.’\nWith these twin psychological mindsets operating beneath the surface, it is only a matter of time before one person manages to unleash the other’s core fear – and neither will notice that they’ve ended up in an insidious pattern of being violently scared and, simultaneously, violently scaring.\nWe can imagine a situation where the anxious partner contacts the avoidant one, only to find that they are, for whatever reason, especially distant or silent. Perhaps the avoidant partner has gone on a trip, or they are working hard, or they’re exploring a new way of being around their friends. Rather than responding as a secure person might (namely, by thinking: ‘I’d prefer this person to be more available, but I can survive without them being so. My life doesn’t depend on anyone but me.’) The anxious person slips into their most archaic and insidious fear: that they cannot cope without their loved one, and that if there is no answer from them, they must start to grip ever harder. As a result, like the proverbial unskilled motorist who slams on the brakes mid-turn, precisely when they shouldn’t, they keep knocking: they insist, they beg, they leave forty-five messages on the other’s phone. They can no longer regulate themselves.\nAll of which is, of course, hellish – and truly shocking – for the avoidant person. In the face of such demands, which evoke the boundary violations and betrayals of their childhood, the avoidant person may feel no option but to stonewall. They can appear deeply sadistic as they withhold reassurance precisely when it is most needed, but they are not trying to make the other person suffer. They are just terrified that they will be annihilated by the noise and insistence. Both partners have lost their reason. For the anxious partner, this is probably the first time they’ve ever allowed someone to matter this much. And for the avoidant one, this may be the first time someone has ever needed them this much. It doesn’t feel good for either of them.\nWhat would be required at such moments is, of course, steadiness on both sides. The anxious party should remember that they are, whatever it feels like, no longer a vulnerable child but a resourceful adult. They could survive the loss of this person, were it to come to that. It wouldn’t be ideal, but it would be eminently OK. They are far stronger than they think. And the avoidant party should similarly remember that they aren’t going to be overwhelmed as they once were. They don’t have to run away and could afford to speak a word or two. They, too, have left childhood behind.\nUnfortunately, these two people – who are probably very clever and mature across other areas of their lives (and perhaps very lovely too) – can entirely fail to see what is at play. Both eventually withdraw to nurse their wounds with the help of mistaken ideologies of love. The anxious one concludes: ‘I knew they would abandon me. People can never be trusted.’ And the avoidant one concludes, with equal darkness and suspicion: ‘I knew they were too much, I need to be on my own.’ Both may feel ashamed in ways they cannot quite master: ashamed of their cruelty to their partner on the one hand, ashamed that they were so undignified with their begging on the other.\nIn the face of such shame, they may fall for the comforting notion that there is someone out there with whom it would all just be easier. They ignore that it would probably be a lot wiser to work through their childhood distortions within their established relationship rather than searching for new difficulties (and trouble) elsewhere. But by the time any insight is reached, it’s likely to be far too late. The avoidant partner may be deep in a state of numbness (it can be impossible for them to process what’s happened), their friends – or perhaps even their therapist – may have got the wrong end of the stick: ‘Find yourself someone less intense.’ While the anxious partner will have fallen prey to similar fantasies around alternatives (someone out there can love me perfectly, someone will spare me any feelings of doubt whatsoever). They might even be vaunting the charms of new love – and believe in them, for now.\nA few lucky people can succeed at love on instinct alone. The rest of us – especially those who have come from more troubled places – have no option but to try to reach calm and steadiness through introspection, reading and a lot of inner therapeutic work. We strive, with all our intelligence, to untangle past from present and separate out fears from facts. It may be the achievement of a lifetime.",

      "text": "There is a paradox around regret when it comes to relationships. The more we learn about ourselves and others, the more regrets we are liable to feel about how our lives have unfolded. The price we pay for increased self-awareness is a heightened sense of responsibility.\nBy contrast, from a position of youthful ignorance, much that happens to us in our love lives simply seems to have no clear reasons behind it and can therefore be interpreted as either inevitable or illogical – and, on this basis, no cause for special mourning. Relationships may have failed, but they couldn’t really have done otherwise. The implosions were close to being acts of God, calling for no particular introspection, atonement or personal acknowledgement. They were dreadful; such things simply happen.\n\nPhoto by Wallace Chuck on Pexels\n\nYet as we learn more about how and why relationships fall apart (or stay together) and our distinctive contributions to these processes, the worse our feelings of loss are likely to grow. It may not simply be fate – or, alternatively, their fault. Ten years after the end of a given love story, we may (with the help of an astute therapist) come to the realisation that there was nothing at all predetermined about the dreadful ending. They pulled away not because of some unbudgeable force. It’s simply – as we now see – because we were holding on far too tightly. We put them under excessive pressure; we suffocated the person we adored. And we now also understand more about why we acted as we did.\nWhen we were small, there was only one person we could rely on, and their presence couldn’t be guaranteed. That’s why the little version of us learnt to be extremely watchful and, later on, came down hard on any lover who showed signs of withdrawal. It’s why we insisted that they call us whenever they were out. It’s why we accused them of betrayal when they were only out dancing with their friends. It makes sense and, at the same time, brings home the immense and unnecessary toll exacted by our blindness.\nFor a second, we almost want to call the lover up – to explain to them that we see it all more clearly now – but it would be no use. Our behaviour chipped away at their love until there was nothing left. The goodwill drained away. They’re married to someone else, sensible and calm in a way we were not. They looked lovely in those recent photos we saw.\nOr imagine that when we were young, we met a person – gifted, funny, kind – who at points we thought, with fervour, would be the love of our lives, the only person we would give our hearts to. But we hadn’t understood the things inside us that would militate against this precious and beautiful hope. We didn’t see the extent of our wounds, where they had come from or how they might impact others. In particular, we didn’t realise that we had never learnt how to communicate anger or hurt – and what the impact of this would be. Resentments built up in us that we couldn’t name or control. We went off sex, thinking this was natural. But deep down, we were furious with them about issues we hadn’t named.\nIn the end, we found ourselves having an affair with someone we didn’t even like. We couldn’t understand why; we wanted to rebel against a hurt buried in our unconscious. By the time the infidelity came to light, the relationship was beyond rescue. Certain precious vases can’t be glued back together again.\nWe’re with someone else now – lovely, kind and reliable – but if we’re honest, we’re still somewhere inside deeply in love. It seems like yesterday, sometimes. They’re living on another continent with two beautiful children. We exchange the odd polite email every three years. We’ll never replace them.\nSuch are the lives of those who dare to learn the proper truths about themselves in love: filled with moments of the most intense sadness at what they ruined and what could have thrived in safer, more knowledgeable hands; the stories that were irredeemably marred because insight came too late. Once we are more self-aware, there will be so many apologies we long to send, so much love that doesn’t know where it can go, so much sadness behind our smiles.",

      "text": "One of the great puzzles of psychology is why kinks exist. Not only are we typically highly selective about who we sleep with, but many of us are – in addition – extremely particular about what will adequately excite us when we do. The sexual act in its raw state is – oddly – far from enough. To allow ourselves to be properly enthusiastic, we may need recourse to very specific sorts of clothes (a tight-fitting suit, a floral dress, labourer’s overalls). And we may then need to ask our partner to adopt equally specific personae (a punitive teacher, a devoted member of the clergy, a high-minded librarian, a ruthless crook, Henry VIII) and set in motion a tightly plotted script that, in its intricacy and specificity, would greatly surprise – and maybe even amuse – an alien visitor attempting to understand Homo sapiens while on an exploratory trip from planet Kepler-22b.\n\nHans Holbein the Younger, Henry VIII, 1537\n\nWhen our frenzy and excitement are over, we might well step back and wonder what we are up to. Why such a charge around certain materials and words, stories and identities? More acutely, how did we come to have the kinks we have? Why very much this and very much not that? What does it say about us that we respond so intensely to particular prompts? Why do our thoughts circle a handful of topics so obsessively? How could we ever explain this to someone else, let alone ourselves?\nA theory of kinks might begin like this: when examined sufficiently richly, every kink appears to sit astride an area of psychological tension or stress, pressure or difficulty. Wherever there is something that excites us, we also find – in a buried form, beneath the superficial play – evidence of pain, often dating back to childhood. To interpret a kink, we must therefore always ask not just: ‘What does a person enjoy?’ but more pointedly: ‘What was difficult for them? What burden are they carrying? What might be exhausting and tricky for them?’\nTo which there are a plethora of answers that typically include:\n— having to be good all the time\n— having to be responsible and mature\n— having to impress through neatness and decency\n— having to be a strong male\n— having to be a demure woman\n— having to manage sibling rivalry\n— having to ensure that one is respected and authoritative\nWith such a theory in hand, we may not even need to ask someone what their kink is. We can simply look out for where the strains in their life are likely to lie – and take an educated guess. Beneath their superficial diversity, kinks tend to cluster with remarkable consistency around a handful of topics. They are attempts to seek solace from fear and anxiety around key pressures: to grow up, to be conscientious, to follow gender codes, to assert ourselves against rivals, to secure our safety, to look after loved ones, to escape vulnerability and to police our status. For a few moments, with a cooperative and sympathetic partner, we can hope to build a miniature utopia that protects us from our ordinary encumbrances. We aren’t just getting idly turned on; we’re in ecstasy because – through the dreamlike distortions of our kinks – we’re intuiting a path towards a less gruelling, more easeful way of living.\nTake the person who might, during sex, greatly enjoy being passive, shouted at and told what to do. We can predict with a certain confidence that this is likely to be someone who is, day to day, in upright life, drained by the need to appear knowledgeable, established and dependable. Similarly, the person who, during sex, abandons ordinary decorum in order to rely on obscenities and rough manners is likely to be the same person who ordinarily feels a particular pressure to be decent, mild and thoughtful. Decades of pressure to be ‘good’ can lead to intense enjoyment around making a mess; those who have grown up ‘too soon’ may most need to return to an earlier, less exacting state. Those who have been denied access to their own fragility may have a taste for delicate fabrics. Those who have stoically never been allowed to cry may have a special inclination for tears.\nIt’s precisely because kinks are related to our sufferings that they can be especially challenging to admit to a prospective partner. We are called upon not just to explain what excites us, but also where we’ve felt especially absurd, inadequate and unacceptable.\nBut this is also why sharing our kinks constitutes an essential part of getting to know someone properly. We might go so far as to say that a relationship without a discussion of kinks will be cut off from a vital source of closeness and awareness. There can – let us venture – be no one who has no kinks at all, only someone who has been denied access to an important part of self-knowledge through shame and fear. Kink-filled sex isn’t simply more ‘fun’, it is a hugely important gateway to a less lonely, less stringent, more self-accepting and more intimate romantic life.",

      "text": "One of the more awful risks in love is when a relationship that might well have been viable is scuppered by a mutual misunderstanding of attachment styles. Two people who may have been on the cusp of building a whole world together part company, both nursing a sense of being mishandled – while not fully fathoming why or how. This is a map of sorts.\n\nPhoto by Jari Hytönen on Unsplash\n\nThe problem begins when a person with what is termed an anxious attachment style meets another with a fearful-avoidant one.\nThe childhood experience of the anxiously attached person is that love is always at risk and can only be guaranteed by constant vigilance and protest. At any moment, the one we care about is liable to slip away – a possibility that must be warded off through complaints, anger and insistent watchfulness. Distance, for the anxiously attached, is always a crisis. Silence must invariably be dreadful. And so, we intensify our demands, ask our partner where they were this afternoon, berate them for sending a message slightly late, and make sure they are aware that we don’t like them having friends or going on holiday alone.\nThis may seem like the best way to secure love, but it is – of course – an entirely doomed strategy in certain cases. Unfortunately, for this poor, benighted anxious soul (no one in this scenario is evil, only very wounded), they are unwittingly generating exactly what their partner most dreads in love: a feeling of being engulfed.\nA different sort of childhood will – usually unbeknownst to both parties – have generated a very different sort of problem in the partner: what is termed a fearful-avoidant attachment style. For this person, the early years will have shown that other human beings are highly likely to be sources of trouble. They will invade one’s space, destroy one’s integrity, give skewed advice, shift their affections randomly to a sibling, make untenable demands and be uninterested in one’s genuine sorrows and cares. From this, this person concludes that the only way to be safe is to retreat and put up barriers. However much they may long for love, in their hearts, true security may only feel possible when they are on their own. These fearful-avoidants don’t keep secrets for the sake of it; their experience has taught them that there isn’t really anyone who can bear them.\nWhat the fearful-avoidant person needs in love is space and time to acclimatise to a dramatically new idea: that someone close to them might genuinely care for them. As the relationship deepens, they experience an ever-greater need for moments of release. It isn’t that they don’t love; they simply have to do so at their own pace and with periods of respite. Their friendships will start to matter more to them precisely when their lover’s role assumes greater prominence. As their commitment to their relationship increases, so does their panic that they may be lost, unsafe, imprisoned. They may – without quite understanding why – start to daydream about sex with strangers and not answer messages in the careful and close way they once did. None of this is a sign that they sincerely and exclusively want out; it’s just their instinctive way of handling terror.\nThe difficulty is that neither party is generally able to understand their fears – or their responses to them – let alone explain them to the other. The anxious person can’t see that they are panicking without full reason to do so and can’t register how frightening their stern and castigating behaviour may seem. Just as the fearful-avoidant person can’t grasp how menacing their withdrawal appears. Both parties, unaware of what is going on inside themselves, can’t find the words to say, politely and while there’s still time: I’m so sorry, I’m gripping too tightly. Or: apologies, I don’t mean to appear cold, I just need to breathe.\nWords that might have saved everything remain unsaid, and an appalling cycle begins. The anxious partner, sensing the withdrawal of their fearful-avoidant companion, presses ever more urgently. They write long emails in the middle of the night, berating them for this or that. And for their part, the avoidant partner becomes increasingly evasive and hard to read. They find reasons to stay out late. They take ever longer to get back on things. There are suddenly a lot of birthday parties they need to go to on their own.\nEventually, the anxiously attached partner can’t take it any longer and engineers a crisis. Even though they are still full of love, they declare that they are walking away – not because they want to, but because their level of worry has grown unsustainable. And for their part, the fearful-avoidant partner, though they may still have a degree of residual affection, has probably gone numb under the pressure and passively watches the relationship collapse – glad that the drama and mayhem can now be over, and they can concentrate on their work and the prospect of new ‘lighter’ relationships going forward.\nIf there is a glimmer of hope, it lies in the fact that these patterns have names. They occur all the time – in Cheshire and New South Wales, in Mallorca and Oslo – and they could be prevented more often with greater awareness (and many months of good, painful psychotherapy). Where both parties aren’t too weary, where the good things still outweigh the bad, a particularly courageous person could one day dare to send the other this piece and say gently: this reminded me a little bit of us.

      "text": "What is it we really hope for and crave in love? One suggestion – deceptively simple to state but hugely hard to unpack, let alone register and find – is this: to be properly seen and properly known.\nWhat we long for isn’t, in the end, to be thought ‘lovely’ or ‘clever’ or ‘beautiful’ (however nice these things might sound). It’s to experience a sense that our companion has the patience, complexity of mind, tolerance and great-heartedness to take on board some of the most difficult things about us and respond with gentleness, curiosity and imagination. Someone who can see the things of which we’re deeply ashamed, that we may have been hiding most of our lives, and that our childhoods have trained us to suppose that no one could bear (and which we often don’t make it all easy for anyone to identify). We don’t want to be adored and admired; we want – beneath the terror and the shadow play, the games and the subterfuges – to be witnessed and held loyally in affection.\n\nPhoto by Yevgeniya Tyumina on Unsplash\n\nIf we think in this context about what a ‘romantic’ moment might really be, it isn’t about elegant dinners or material gift-giving. It’s about moments when we’re able to be heard as we share something that feels immensely complicated and apparently unacceptable. For example: that we have certain kinds of sexual desires that could be judged very harshly by some. Or that we are still hung up on someone else. Or that we have a crush where we shouldn’t. Or that we have a lot of professional anxieties or difficulties. Or that we feel very strange about an aspect of our appearance. Or that we deeply dislike ourselves and are, at points, mentally very unwell, full of self-hatred and despair.\nIt can be terrifying to show our confusions to anyone. But, as a general rule, the harsher our childhoods, the more afraid and obtuse we will be around daring to do so. What we mean by a bad childhood is, in essence, a childhood in which – for a variety of reasons – who we were wasn’t remotely acceptable to our parents or caregivers. A childhood that leaves us with a legacy of shame around who we are, and an ingrained furtiveness designed to ensure that no one will ever be allowed to come close. In an unloving childhood, our reality won’t have been anyone’s proper concern; no one will have come down to our level and sympathised with how we felt (when we were in a rage or embarrassed, sad or confused). Instead, there will merely have been great pressure to adjust to someone else’s priorities: for example, a very angry and volatile father, a highly fragile and withdrawn mother. We had to be good, clean, noble, strong, feminine, masculine, etc., long before we were ready. And though we may have ended up performing well (unloved people often become experts in how to win the world’s approval), the damage to our sense of trust and self-esteem will have been immense. We will have imbibed a tragic lesson: ‘If I show someone who I really am, I will infuriate them and inevitably prompt abandonment. No one can know me as I am and stick by me.’\nOne way to interpret the multiple difficulties that people have around adult relationships is to read them as symptoms of overwhelming anxiety around being properly seen and known, stemming from childhood neglect. After a bad first decade, we are likely to show up on the dating scene with grave complexities around the business of being witnessed. Perhaps we will be unfeasibly shy about pushing ourselves forward with anyone. We will withdraw the moment someone else is interested in us. Or we may act ‘nice’ but then, after a while, can’t maintain the pretence any longer and will have an affair or go off the person who (usually entirely unbeknownst to them) has triggered a feeling of unreality. We never allow a relationship to deepen; at just the moment when proper intimacy is called for, we flee – and don’t really know why. We may blame the partner for not understanding us, while omitting to note that we are making it very hard for even the loveliest person to do so; we blame them for a state of misunderstanding that we ourselves have carefully engineered. Or, as another response to the same problem, we pick someone almost guaranteed not to see us, someone obviously not interested in us, so that we don’t have to face the oscillation between our longing to be seen and our dread that we never will be.\nA lot of these anxieties show up particularly in that bellwether of relationships: sex. Here, in heightened form, we can wind up being fake and ‘good’ for the sake of appearing normal. We can’t find pleasure in sex – a moment that should be one of huge honesty and freedom – because, at heart, we don’t believe anyone could properly know us and stay with us. Our sexual inhibition becomes a metaphor for a wider emotional secrecy. We shouldn’t be surprised. How could anyone have an honest orgasm who had never, in the wider scheme, felt they could be tolerated by another human?\nIt may take us most of our lives to realise our fears and set about putting alternative strategies in place:\n— Refusing people who we sense, if we are frank with ourselves, don’t have the psychological equipment to understand us.\n— Locating more suitable partners and tolerating the nausea and terror that they may provoke; recognising that our discomfort is about a fear of being understood, rather than any defect in them.\n— Knowing that the more unimpressive, lost and perverse we can appear to someone, the greater the opportunity for our bond with them to grow.\n— Identifying what we are most ashamed of and then finding words that are substantially true but also reasonably diplomatic, shaping our private agonies and desires into something that someone who is kind and listening carefully will be able to take on board.\n—Allowing ourselves to feel how good it is when our truths are met with sympathy and tenderness; knowing that this – at last – is love; appreciating that this, finally, is what it should always have felt like.",

      "text": "If we think about what love might look like in a work of art, certain stock images tend to come to mind: a couple kissing on a bridge, a wistful soul gazing out to sea at dusk, two hands interlaced …\nBut in a true ideal museum of love, one work would deserve a central place – even though it seems, at first glance, to have nothing whatsoever to do with love. \nVincent Van Gogh completed it in a few days in the summer of 1888. Drawn in ink reinforced with pencil on a sheet of brown paper, it depicts a flat stretch of the southern French countryside, near the city of Arles, where Van Gogh was living.\n\nVincent van Gogh, La Crau from Montmajour, France, July 1888 © The Trustees of the British Museum\n\nA depiction of a landscape, it is simultaneously a testament to an act of uncommonly concentrated attention – an essay on rare and patient noticing. Where we might have been tempted to hurry by, Van Gogh has remained fixed and registered everything: a small figure ploughing a field, two men walking down a path, a local train – some of whose carriages are carrying goods, others passengers – crossing in the middle distance, and then the earth, always the earth, in its manifold varieties: wheat stubble, trampled grass, loose and tilled soil – each difference marked by the artist’s careful, rhythmic hatchings and cross-hatchings. Humanity emerges as a modest, touching species, making its indentations on a vast world beneath an ordinary sun.\nThere is no overt moral, no apparent ‘message’. It is, at one level, just a ‘view’ – and yet it might bring tears to our eyes. For what Van Gogh is doing is correcting our ordinary inattention and haste, pulling against our usual sadness and self-hatred, and calling out for renewed care and sympathy. This is looking as a god might at its creation, or a parent at their child – holding in mind the shape of a young one’s fingers, their lips as they articulate a word, a lock of their hair. ‘A bit of countryside’ has been translated – under this supremely generous artist’s gaze – into a phenomenon worthy of infinite regard; the difference between ‘a child’ and ‘your child’, ‘a person’ and ‘your partner’, ‘a stranger’ and ‘a loved one’. \nVan Gogh is modelling for us a care that is, in the end, deeply transferable – one that can shift from the trees and fields of southern France to life more broadly, to a level of sympathy and appreciation we know we owe to one another, and would give, if only we were not so often burdened and afraid. We are being gently goaded to live with greater awareness and charity, to turn our reflex guardedness and solemnity into something less defended and more tender. We may think we have been shown a view. But we turn away and learn – once again – to notice one another.",

      "text": "It sounds, at one level, absurd to have to hold back from expressing the full intensity of our feelings for certain people we love. Surely there should be no room in this area for what we blithely call ‘games’; if we are besotted, we should tell our companion of our adoration without fear or compunction. We should be able to declare plainly that we think about them all the time, find them lovely looking, and might want to marry them one day. We should – in addition – happily expect to see them often, get jealous whenever they stay out late with friends and pull a long face if they tell us that they might one day want to go on a trip to Madagascar, Mongolia or Peru – without us.\nIt sounds like a sensible strategy, full of an aspiration for closeness and honesty, but it is only wise if we forget one thing: that many of us cannot – with the best will in the world – absorb love in undiluted doses. Some of us grew up in environments that were so lacking in warmth that, in order to survive, we had to remould our characters in the direction of emotional diffidence and self-suspicion. When we received no positive feedback, when all the love went to a sibling, when low self-esteem and defended isolation became the norm, we cannot expect that things will go well the moment a kind – and perhaps puppyish and anxious – lover arrives on the scene. The leading reaction to suddenly finding ourselves the target of another’s adoration may not be gratitude or safety so much as a feeling of danger, confinement, oppression and disgust. We may – to defend our integrity – have to start to hate the person who overwhelms us with an unfamiliar bounty of care, even though, at some level, we are so grateful for all the sweetness they show us. If the emotional food we most lacked in childhood is delivered in rich, over-seasoned portions, we may have no choice but to spit it out.\n\nPhoto by Giacomo Folli on Unsplash\n\nIf we truly cherish someone, we should be concerned not just with telling them they are delightful and that we want to be with them until the end of time. We should undertake the greater additional effort of the imagination: to understand their relationship to being admired and to understand that our care may, in order to make its way through to them safely, need to be cast in more hedged and covert ways.\nIt&#8217;s not, in the end, very kind to choke someone with love, to hold them so tightly to us that they must fight for space, and to leave them feeling hugely guilty and inadequate for not being able to meet us exactly halfway in our ecstasies. To hold on to a person we truly care about for the long term, we may have to put our own ardour aside and attune ourselves ­– perhaps for the first time – to their distinctive way of metabolising affection. We should ask not just ‘What do I want to give?’ but also, ‘How are they built to receive?’ Even if it isn’t our first choice, we may have to leave them room to miss us; we may have to let them see their friends a lot, we may have to let them go on holiday without us, we might need resist calling them all the time and not make a fuss when they are a bit late with a text message. And we will need to do this not because we don’t care but because we care so much, and can at last see that the price for not doing so will be to lose them altogether. That would be an ultimate tragedy we will regret all our lives. We can leave them to their own devices, sure in the knowledge that they need space not because they are bad or uncaring or about to desert us, but because they are – on account of their miserable childhoods – as terrified of love as they are thrilled by it.\nWhen we truly love someone, it may be the greatest kindness not to love them too much, too suddenly, or too insistently. We may have to give them a great deal of room so that that they can remain close. We may have to pretend not to fear losing them, in order to ensure that we never do so.",

      "text": "Our age does us a huge disservice by routinely and rigidly equating normality and happiness with membership of a couple. We are typically made to feel as if there could really be no sane alternative to having a life-long partner; as if every other possible arrangement would have to indicate a pernicious flaw in our character.\n\nOther eras have not been as prescriptive. For most of the history of humanity, it was uncomplicatedly accepted that conjugal life couldn’t possibly suit everyone and that certain individuals would therefore need to remain single in order to make the most of their lives. Perhaps a person (maybe a very creative one) was too taken up with work or had no interest in children, needed a lot of time on their own or got tetchy around large groups, was unusually devoted to God or liked to express themselves sexually outside of a loving union – in short, it was understood that the best sides of a certain sort of person might not emerge from being with someone else all the time. \n\nThe name given to this choice was celibacy, the deliberate renunciation of love. The word is now often confused with chastity, the deliberate renunciation of sex; though it is quite different, indicating merely a decision not to entangle oneself emotionally with another, while otherwise remaining very open to sexual experience. It’s not so much that celibacy is forbidden in our society as that it is frowned upon. Some people live alone of course. But the default assumption is that they would ideally like to be with someone else - or should want to be, were they were not somehow mad or mentally ill. Two hugely unfair and negative images accompany the term celibate in the cultural imagination; that of 'the spinster', the woman who no one wanted to marry. And the ‘confirmed bachelor’, the closet weirdo who is pictured as very much wanting to be with someone but prevented from being so due to their many shortcomings. The idea that someone might be perfectly capable of establishing a relationship and yet be deliberately and specifically choosing to live by themselves appears deeply frightening to our age - perhaps because we unconsciously sense in celibacy a freedom of which we’re profoundly jealous.\n\nA truly evolved society would not be so aggressive in forcing its cohorts into couples. Only when being single truly has equal status with being in a couple can we be sure that people are pairing up for the right reasons, that is, on the ground of mutual attraction and psychological affinity, rather than in order to escape from social opprobrium. For all the vaunted liberations of our time, we need to liberate one last category, the celibate, from the weight of unfair prejudice and stigma. We need to offer closet celibates the chance to acknowledge and feel pride in their distinctive characters from the earliest age, so that they can avoid the unnecessary sufferings and recriminations of that deeply outmoded trap: the sham or miserable marriage."

      "text": "One of the most galling and drily comedic things about relationships is that many of the struggles we had with our now ex-partners – though they appeared circular and fruitless at the time – are likely to be precisely what will help them to become, in the future, ideal partners … for someone else. It’s the very difficulties we had – the arguments, blind spots and stalemates – that will prepare them for unions filled with insight, harmony and serenity next time around. Unbeknownst to us, we may, for a long while, have been in the business of helping someone else to be very happy.\n\nJohn Constable, Shoreham Bay, Evening Sunset, 1828\n\nThere will typically be few signs of our unwittingly selfless groundwork. The fraught closing stages of the relationship are unlikely to have seemed like an emotional finishing school or a forum for psychological maturation. There might have been a succession of seemingly sterile fights when we questioned why they spent so much time obsessing about their brother or expecting their mother to rescue them. There might have been a variety of tense conversations about certain friends or their approach to work. We might have been accused of being ‘mean’ or ‘overly critical.’ Perhaps there was a sulk that lasted twelve hours, and a moment when they called us a blockhead and we told them we wished we’d never met them (even though, or precisely because, we loved them so deeply).\nWe can be charitable towards these choppy moments. Relationships typically involve sincere attempts by both partners to raise the other’s levels of self-awareness and empathy. None of us is perfect, and the arena in which these imperfections are first identified and grappled with is in the close-up conditions of love. The problem isn’t our mutual educational intent, but the terrible way in which it’s generally carried out. We are, on the whole, very poor ‘teachers’ and equally bad ‘students’. In the ‘teaching’ role, we spot multiple things in our partners but are so worried that they won’t understand or change that we almost guarantee they never will. We address them in high-handed, urgent moods. We forget that no one has ever learnt anything by being humiliated. We try to get them to see a vital point in the middle of the night, when we are both exhausted, or on the way to the airport or a doctor’s appointment. We forget to deploy humour and reassurance. We think it will help things if we spice up our lessons with phrases like ‘and everyone knows this about you …’ or ‘you’re exactly like your dad …’ And when we are in the ‘student’ role, we are equally unimaginative, brittle and hasty: we swiftly resent the partner for spotting something complicated in our characters that we know, deep down, needs addressing, and disingenuously complain to our friends that our partner doesn’t love us ‘as we are’ (as though anyone should ever do such a thing). In fear, we regressively equate true love with boundless approval. We cannot allow that someone should both be deeply on our side and justly want to criticise us.\nNevertheless, once the heat has gone out of the moment, once we have taken the decision to part and cried alone in our apartment over many weeks, some of the things we most wanted to get across to our partners (and they to us) will finally have a chance to be absorbed. When the other is no longer in the vicinity, when a point isn’t being made with vehemence or insistence, it can become easier to think that yes, perhaps, there might have been something to reflect on – about one’s relationship to a sibling or a parent, a friendship or a professional matter. Pride is no longer on the line. Dignity is no longer ruffled. When the ‘classroom’ has been blown up and the teacher dismissed, homework can finally begin.\nAnd so, months or years later, our erstwhile partner may arrive in a new relationship with the fault lines we fought over with such agitation now substantially healed. In their attractive outfit (which we bought with them), gazing into the middle distance, they may casually remark: ‘I had some problems with my brother a while back, but that’s all sorted out now …’ Or they may, as they pour themselves a little more white wine, explain with uncommon sagacity that ‘making time for personal life is very important to me, however much I enjoy my job’ – and the new partner will take delight in how extraordinarily grounded and poised their beloved appears to be in so many ways.\nIt could sound like the grounds for bitterness – were it not for one redemptive detail: the process is likely to be two-way. With any luck, we too will eventually meet someone who appears, entirely naturally, to have a deep understanding of themselves, a mature way of relating to their flaws and a deft way of sailing over the complexities in their character. They will apologise before we even think of saying anything, they’ll seem miraculously open to feedback over certain topics, and their insight into the complexities of their past will awe us. We’ll think that this is the way they were born. No one will know – &nbsp;and everyone will feel – after so many tears with their tricky ex, hugely blessed.",

But the reality – sober, private, dark – is a great deal more disturbing, indeed almost impossible to accept: that whatever we try, anxiety may simply be a constant within us, not something that will ever quite leave us alone. It is the most protean and inventive of afflictions, always finding new ways to return, to disturb us and insert itself between us and what we are trying to appreciate – a beautiful day, an orange tree, our children. What we worry about will change; that we will worry never seems to.\nWhy? What has cursed us – we the worried cohort – singled out for lifelong punishment, never free to forget our dangers and regrets and shame for longer than a few hours?\n\nEdvard Munch, Melancholy, 1891\n\nMaybe we should cease – on top of everything else – to worry that we are worried. We should accept our affliction with grace, contained rage and resigned good humour.\nWe are, after all, worried for such sound reasons: because we were born into a world without guarantees of anything. Because we have been abandoned before, and may be so again. Because we were not held or soothed properly at the start, and fear is now encoded in our bodies. Because mother was frightening and father was shouting. Because others were cruel far before we were ready to locate the problem in them, rather than in ourselves.\nWe worry because – even as our capacity to master events has grown – so too have the challenges. Because we got together with the wrong person, or the right one left us. Because our financial affairs became complicated. Because politics went mad. Because our bodies became vulnerable. Because we acquired enemies. Because time is running out very fast. Because we don’t have enough of the right kinds of friends; those who allow us to be weak, those who suffer as we do, those who can be gentle because they know our fragility from the inside. We worry because we still don’t have a true home, where the pretence can cease and we can cry as we need to.\nThere are so many suggested cures for our sense of threat: to breathe more deeply, to exercise, to take fresh air, to eat more fruit, to sit in silence. These are deeply well-meaning. We love the gurus who proffer them. But just as important might be the right to name the problem and complain about it loudly, without pressure to be wise or remotely grown-up. To be allowed to weep copiously, and (quietly) scream. To have the privilege of finding other people who suffer as we do, and who will not force sentimentality or denial on us.\nPerhaps the greatest peace available to us comes from knowing that our torment is never quite going to end. We may find pleasure in beautiful pictures of calm, in promises of serenity; but they will forever elude us inside. To accept this is the ultimate stiff consolation. We’re strange, but we don’t need to feel uniquely cursed. Many of us are exactly the same, even if we can rarely say so in public, even if there is little outward evidence. For our part, we understand. We know. We feel exactly the same way. We could be the best of friends, companions through the lands of worry, waiting to embrace one another in our sorrows, and laugh with tenderness and despair at the unceasing, cruel pain.",

They answer to one name, have one passport, and their body forms a coherent boundary.\n\nPhoto by Bianca Fazacas on Unsplash\n\nBut inside, things may be far more multiple. Our partner may house a confederacy of selves rather than a unitary executive. Sitting around the board table of their identity might be a wide variety of characters, each waiting to take the microphone at different times of the week – or hour:\n— a good child who wants to please everyone \n— a furious child who resents their submission\n— someone who wants to obey their father\n— someone who wants to kill their father\n— someone who really loves you\n— someone who wonders if you’re any good\n— someone who thinks they’re tolerable\n— someone who thinks they are hateful\n— someone who only listens to their friends\n— someone who chiefly listens to social media\n— someone who wants whatever their sibling has\n— someone totally satisfied with you\n— someone who wants admiration from a rotating cast of random strangers\nAnd so on. \nThough it might seem that they are our partner, in truth, we lay claim to about one-twentieth of their true identity. Which is not nothing, but not quite enough for a tolerable existence.\nPeople don’t become confederacies by accident. They do so because, at a formative moment, they couldn’t trust any one person to be a source of safety. Perhaps their mother wasn’t reliable. Their father wasn’t focused. Their friends weren’t solidly there for them. Their sibling was deceitful. From this, they learnt a basic lesson: never commit. It’s not that no care came from any direction; it’s just that it never did so in a sustained or secure way. And so, they learnt to respond by congenitally hedging their bets.\nEverything developed a question mark: lover? Friend? Lawyer? Intellectual? Athlete? Red or blue? Up or down? Black or grey? They became inherently plural (also often late – because how can someone who wants to be everywhere guarantee the specificity required by punctuality?). ‘Maybe’, ‘perhaps’, ‘hang on,’ ‘let me get back to you…’ became favourite rhetorical survival phrases. They decided to listen to everyone with the same hovering charm and surface politeness in an attempt to delay the costs of commitment. They would diversify the perceived emotional risks of connection by distributing them widely among friends, trends, parents, images. That way, no single betrayal, no single letdown, could ever, ever, break them again. \nThis might be a clever strategy for survival; it’s a difficult one for love. Because love, to flourish, needs someone who can finally decide – who can say, in an anchored, clear and brave voice: ‘I choose you above the others. I’ll silence the other voices, enough to make our love real’. It requires someone who has developed an internal executive – someone who is inwardly solid enough to unify their cabinet around a single target of affection.\nAt the origins of our partner’s prevarication lies the uncertainty of others towards them. They don’t know what they want because no one has ever been clear that they were the object of particular desire and care. They can’t choose because they were never chosen. They can’t make you feel special because they were never made to feel special. They can’t say who they are because they didn’t exist solidly in anyone else’s imagination. They can’t ever say ‘I really, really want you’ because no one ever – long ago – said that they really, really wanted them.\nThey may – one twentieth of the time – be the loveliest people in the world. The rest of the relationship, they will drive us close to madness with an elusiveness we deserve to name and finally see clearly.",

For some of us, love is as terrifying in practice as it is desirable in the abstract – and our chief response to being loved may not be kindness and welcome but, strangely and yet with dark logic, cruelty.\n\nHilma af Klint, The Swan (No. 17), 1915\n\nStated simply: certain people who were harshly treated in childhood (a not inconsiderable portion of the population) will – when deep love is offered to them – begin to treat their partner in many of the ways they were once treated by their early caregivers: with the same uncertainty and contempt, coldness and sadism. Their responses become a palimpsest, in which they can read an account of the most painful parts of their own childhood – except that now the partner is the victim, and they have become the perpetrators.\nIf we were in a relationship with such a person, they might show up early on in the relationship full of good qualities. They would be warm, notice tender things about us, disarm our defences and invite in our childhood needs. But then, just as we were falling in love, something within them that they have barely grasped would be activated. They would stop turning up on time. They would leave our messages unanswered. They would cease asking us about our lives. They would discover friends they needed to spend a lot of time with. Work would demand everything of them. At worst, they would begin to flirt with others. If we complained, they would become stern. They would accuse us of imagining problems and of being ‘needy’. They would say we were ‘too much’. Having created emotional havoc, they would step back and coldly wonder why we couldn’t be more stable.\nWhat might be at play? Unbeknownst to us – and usually to them – our beloved is walking the world with a set of deep-seated and extremely difficult suspicions about relationships, shaped by what happened to them in their family of origin before the age of ten. The suspicion that vulnerability (theirs and their partner’s) is, in essence, disgusting. That to show need is repulsive. That people are unreliable and will invariably leave you for someone else (it may have been their sibling). That a hunger for love is shameful. That others don’t have their real interests at heart. That they are unworthy and intolerable in their full reality.\nThe partner sees in us what they once had to kill off in themselves to make it to adulthood: the same nakedness, hunger and defencelessness. We are now the weaklings they were once accused of being. And they inadvertently defend themselves against the echo of their fragility by showing us the same sternness, unreliability and coldness that their parental figures once deemed good for them. They take us through – in compressed form – everything they had to endure over their first ten years: feeling like they are too much, not as interesting as someone else, unwanted. Our need summons up their buried longings – to which they respond with brutality.\nIf we make a simple list of everything they now make us feel, and then do the same for what their parents once made them feel, we’re likely find an almost identical list of adjectives.\nThere is generally no way to signal to our formally kind and generous partner that they have become what we might call sadistic. If it were that easy for them to see, they wouldn’t need to act out the issue.\nWe may simply have to escape. Which may not be easy, because we have probably also been seduced into imagining (as they once had to imagine, as children) that we deserve the ill-treatment we are being accorded. As we fight for our lives, we need to keep powerfully reminding ourselves of what should always be plain common-sense: that true love never involves inflicting pain. That true love is always indulgent to weakness. That true love is infinitely kind.",

      "text": "One of the odder features of life is that, without there being too many significant outward signs of the problem, many people are to be found wandering the earth lacking any sense of self.\nWhat It Means to Lack a Sense of Self\nBy this, we mean that they are radically unsure of who they might be, what they might want and whom they should trust. These unfortunates have no settled core. In the background, they are always quietly asking themselves not ‘What do I like?’ but ‘What am I supposed to like?’; Not ‘What do I approve of?’ but ‘What is it good to approve of?’; not ‘What do I find funny?’ but ‘When should I laugh?’ When we watch them carefully, we may notice rapid, almost arbitrary shifts in their views: they love this artist or jacket or political opinion … but in fact, no, they prefer another one, and then another. They are implicitly, constantly calling out to a world that puzzles and terrifies them: Who should I be? What is it right to think?\n\nPhoto by Pauline Loroy on Unsplash\n\nThese poor souls tend to be the products of very particular sorts of childhoods. When little, they will have faced environments in which their uniqueness was never a matter of concern to their self-absorbed caregivers. Mother or father were never able to push their needs aside for a time, drop to the child’s level and ask: Who is this extraordinary new member of the human race whom I have helped to create? What are their particular inclinations, loves and hates? What do they have to tell me?\nThey were far too perturbed and fragile for such self-abnegation. They couldn’t attune to the child – and so the child could not, in turn, attune to themselves. For we can only find out what we think if, in the early days, someone is sufficiently patient to facilitate our own process of self-discovery; if someone doesn’t shout over us and say, ‘Don’t be ridiculous,’ when we ventured forth an opinion, or doesn’t use all the resources of adulthood to insist that their way is the only way.\nWhen Pleasing Others Becomes a Personality\nThe self-less child will have had to cope with an egotist who simply coerced them to follow an already predetermined agenda: these are the books you need to think are amazing; the only way to be a good boy or girl is to win at this kind of sport or that school subject; and later, to be a banker or a vet, and so on – all without in any way bothering to check in on how this might have felt to the small person biologically programmed to adore and revere them. From this was drawn a moral: survival depends on compliance. The price of existing is the sacrifice of one’s real identity.\nSelf-less people can be deeply charming. Their manner can be exquisitely polite and mellifluous. They are built to work out what we like and to reflect it back to us. They aren’t merely pretending to go along with what we think for a few minutes; they genuinely seek out our worldview and lose themselves in it.\nWhen Love Turns into Projection\nBut these people also pose grave dangers, for no one forgoes their sense of self without storing up a significant degree of rage and dissatisfaction. Yet this can never emerge cleanly because the candid expression of their needs was never something that these self-less people were allowed to practice. The first we are liable to learn about a problem they have with us is when it has become unmanageable.\nWe can be most at risk if we fall in love with these elusive, beguiling, shape-shifting people. At first, it’s our tastes they want to understand; it’s the books and places and foods we like that seem especially interesting to them. We can allow ourselves a dangerous moment of self-indulgence: we are made to feel marvellous and aren’t suspicious enough to wonder why.\nThe Disorienting Fallout of a Borrowed Identity\nUntil, at some point, the wind changes. Our beloved-without-a-self starts a new job, develops different friends, and starts to hang out with a crowd they take to be superior. What replaces their approval of us isn’t just gentle disinterest, it will probably be disdain. We become as repulsive to them as we were once extraordinary. They may say, ‘You don’t really know me…’ or ‘You expect me to be perfect…’ They feel trapped by the very borrowed identity they once sought out so avidly from us. There is considerable anger in their system – because they know that someone has quashed their true self; they simply forget that it wasn’t us. They know implicitly that they have been prevented from becoming who they are and hold us responsible for stifling them. They may say with an early adolescent level of scorn, ‘You’re controlling me,’ when what they really mean is: ‘I don’t know who I am. I have surrendered control to you and now can’t work out what to think.’ Or, more profoundly, ‘I can’t determine the line between being loved and being controlled because a parent who was meant to do the former was more interested in the latter.’ We can find ourselves dropped like a stone. And yet, ironically, we may have been very right for them: they just didn’t know enough about who they were to trust their original instincts.\nThe best we can do for people who have been denied a self is to signal that we aren’t, as their parents once were, only there to foist yet another set of views on them. We won’t demand that they echo us. We want to be curious about someone they have never yet been allowed to discover; we are keen to do a very eerie and unparalleled thing: get to know them properly.",

There’s very little evidence that human events can be shaped by the movements of the planets, the interventions of airborne spirits or the incantation of wishes. \nBut this isn’t the point. What the self-congratulatingly rational are missing is that their rationality is not, and never was, an achievement of the intellect. It’s no sign of logical superiority or hard-won ratiocination. It’s the result of something they seldom wish to acknowledge or express appropriate gratitude for: luck.\nIt’s their background good fortune – nothing more nor less – that means they have never been tempted to fall to their knees and implore an angel or to send someone a letter telepathically or to gain comfort from reading what could be in store for a Sagittarius with an ex they pine for this month.\nIt’s because their child isn’t dying of cancer, their beloved didn’t leave them without explanation after five years of marriage and their mortgage payments aren’t in arrears that they can calmly step back and trust in the orderly and ineluctable unfolding of the principles of science.\nThey should display greater imagination towards those whom they so coldly scorn. They may not agree with their mental machinations, but they should spare a thought for what might have inspired them. The superstitious are not any more limited than they are; they are simply in far greater pain. The odds they face are monstrously larger.\nThe origins of rationality don’t lie in reason at all. They lie in a feeling that the truth can be accepted: that lovers will be kind, that bodies will function, that the financial system will provide, that children will be safe. We can all afford to be sensible – until our luck runs out. Credulity is a measure of despair, not of intelligence.

      "text": "Being left by someone who once loved us – and whom we still adore – has to count among the most soul-destroying of all emotional eventualities. It is – if we can put it crudely – completely awful, and anyone to whom it has happened deserves our immediate and unbounded sympathy. However, this basic fact should never obscure an important nuance: that there are two quite different versions of horrible. There is very bad. And then there is very, very bad indeed.\n\nHenri Matisse, Woman Before an Aquarium, 1921–1923 Source: Fuzheado, Wikimedia Commons\n\nLet’s look first at the merely very bad. In this version, someone who once loved us comes to us cleanly and promptly and says something like the following: ‘I respect and admire you so much. I am so grateful to you in a million ways. It’s just that something in me has changed. I need to start the next chapter of my life elsewhere. I can and will explain more in due course, but for now, I know this is devastating, and you have every right to feel betrayed by me. Please don’t think that this negates what came before. I simply need something different going forward.’\nThis – let’s make no bones about it – is very sad. But it’s eminently survivable. It will cost you weeks, maybe months, but it won’t take years, and you will make a full recovery.\nNow let’s look at the catastrophe. This starts in complete silence, with our partner doing some of the following: no longer answering messages on time, no longer pulling their weight around the house, flirting with other people, refusing sex, being ill-tempered and short, being grumpy and elsewhere and staying out late with friends who don’t like or know us. But when we complain, the tables are turned. They accuse us of being ‘too intense’ or ‘controlling’ or ‘exacting’ or ‘engulfing’ or ‘not being interested in having fun anymore …’ They wait for us to get desperate and lose our emotional footing – and then they stand back and ask with innocence: ‘Why can’t you be more relaxed? Why can’t we have a bit more space in this relationship?’\nEventually we have to pull this person aside and say: ‘I can’t take it anymore. I think I have to leave; I’m not at peace here.’ And if we’re really unlucky, they’ll burst into tears and say ‘No, how awful – what little faith you have in me.’ We then have to watch them cry for a relationship they no longer wanted and feel like we are a bad person for ending a misery they did everything not to mitigate.\nFor a while, our irritation with them obscures from our minds the poignant truth of our hearts: that we adore them still, that we want so much to be with them. And yet the guilt of the ending rests entirely on us. We wind up feeling that we’ve been the mean-spirited and impatient instigators of a withdrawal of which we’re the pained victims.\nEventually, our partner will go off into the night – tearfully but, as we fail to note, without any actual protest – leaving us entirely haunted: what did we do wrong? Could we have tried harder? Were we impatient?\nWe’ll keep imagining – because they’ve done nothing to persuade us otherwise – that they still love us (as we cherish them); it’s only that the relationship has mysteriously become ‘impossible’, maybe because of something very wrong with us (we may self-diagnose a fear of intimacy or an anxious attachment style). We’ll beg them to return, and if we’re really unlucky, they’ll say yes – only to rehearse their surreptitious disengagement a second, a third, or even a fourth time. So committed are they to seeming ‘nice’, they turn into monsters – and drive us to the edge of insanity.\nIf healing is ever possible, it depends on our ability to trace the lies back to their camouflaged sources. Recovery depends on us eventually being able to think a simple-sounding truth: however tricky things might be, however many issues there are, no relationship ever collapses unless – and until – one person quietly wants it to. If that person isn’t us, then it must be the other person. If it’s not me, it’s them.\nWe can allow ourselves to think at last: This relationship I revered ended only and solely because I had a partner who very privately wanted to get out – but didn’t have the decency or mental equipment to admit as much.\nThe tragedy is that we can be two or three years down the line from a breakup at this point. The waste of time is shocking. The damage to our nerves and our sense of reality is enormous, and the knock-on effect on other attempts to fall in love is equally grave.\nThis, therefore, is a message to all exiting partners: never leave without properly admitting that this is what you are doing – and pay the full price for your intent. Stop loving if you need to; but in the name of mercy, do your partner the honour of telling them unambiguously what has changed in your heart. Stop trying to seem nice – and, finally, in the only real sense, be nice.",

      "text": "There’s a familiar expression that captures a deep psychological truth: ‘when people tell you who they are, believe them’.&nbsp;\nWhat does this mean? It means that certain people constantly reveal to us some of their deep-seated inclinations towards unkindness, treachery, vanity and selfishness. They make no bones about their cowardice or greed. They may simply – and in broad daylight – declare their harmful natures, taking no precautions in offering up stories from which a negative moral is blatantly clear.&nbsp;\n\nPhoto by Dulcey Lima on Unsplash\n\nBut for our part, we miss every one of these clues. We remain too hopeful, too naive, too much on the other’s side, and not enough on our own to trust in the omens we are witnessing. And in the process, we destroy our lives.\nImagine someone who never returns any of our generosity. Or someone who tells us they didn’t ‘mean’ to hurt us by flirting with other people but continues to do so regardless. Or someone who intermittently disappears without warning. Or someone who again and again responds with defensiveness to ideas that matter to us. Or someone who greets every warm comment from us with curt, dismissive replies. Or someone who never invites us to meet any of their friends. Or someone who is half-hearted in saying thank you or always says ‘maybe’ when we need a ‘yes’. Or someone who never asks us anything about ourselves.\nAll of these are extremely clear communications. They are ways for our interlocutors to tell us, in ironclad terms, in effect: I am not to be trusted. I don’t respect you. I have other things that matter more to me than you. Your feelings aren’t a concern to me. I don’t love you. I don’t have a moral code. I’m not accountable, and I will put my comfort far above your needs.\nOne would think that such alarming truths would immediately enter our consciousness and lead us to walk away and defend our interests. The problem is that some of us are not remotely built to notice the attacks made on us by others. We listen and we look but the deeper import of what we’re witnessing evades us. Yes, of course the other person seems a bit distracted, we concede, but perhaps they are busy or exhausted or taken up temporarily with other thoughts. Yes, it’s true that their behaviour isn’t entirely gentle or considerate, but isn’t it the case that they were pretty kind to us a year ago and once promised to take us out for a treat (even if they later forgot to do so)?\nThe thing we can’t do is lay appropriate and proportionate emphasis on the darkness. The truth – that we have a dangerous con artist, or worse, on our hands – constantly evades us. And the reason is simple: we were never educated to despair correctly of people who frustrated, neglected, ignored, tantalised or blindfolded us. We weren’t able to squarely acknowledge the harmful nature of those around us, because these people happened to carry the title of parent or caregiver, and no child can afford to give up cleanly on those on whose existence it depends. No child can believe fully in the bad news of their family of birth – which is why the truth gets twisted unbearably: my father is lovely; he’s just a bit tough. My father did care for me; he just got married to someone else. My mother is sweet; she’s just busy. My stepfather is nice; he just looks at me a little strangely at times.\nFrom this enforced ‘generosity’ towards the harmfulness of others, we develop a lifelong bias towards not believing bad news from people in our circle. When we end up in a relationship with someone who – beneath a sweet manner – constantly disrespects us, it may take us five years to wake up to the humiliation. The last thing on our mind is that someone close to us could be a disreputable turncoat, even though the signs may have been piling up, and all our true friends knew it from the start.\nOnce we wake up and learn to properly believe the negative verdicts we’re being served up, there will – it is true – be far fewer individuals we’d ever consider dating, working with, marrying or continuing to spend time with. That sounds like a pity. But it is an even greater pity, indeed a tragedy, to keep insisting that certain people are decent, about to take us seriously, or are faithful when they are not. We need to finally and fairly give up on those who betray us in order to recover a lost loyalty towards someone we have neglected and disrespected for far too long: our vulnerable, worthy, true, intelligent selves.&nbsp;",

      "text": "Among the many skills required to have a good relationship, one stands out above any other: the capacity to live without a relationship. \nOnly those who have fully made their peace with the prospect of being single can have the calm, steadiness and courage to face down the problems in love with the necessary conviction or, outside of relationships, to endure the many months, even years or decades, that it might take for the right person to appear.&nbsp;\n\nPhoto by Maria Ivanova on Unsplash\n\nOnly if we know we can survive alone can we ever have the confidence to ask for changes from a partner and be known to mean it. Our ultimatums can’t be faked. Our partners have a sixth sense of how far they can push us before we walk away – and if we never can, if we dread solitude more than we do mistreatment, we can be toyed with without end. We must always be aware that we might need to get out – only in order to foster the conditions that mean we will never need to. We must be like a nation that every year practices a military drill, not because it knows it will be attacked but in order to reduce the chances it ever will be. Even in the midst of the greatest cosiness, wise lovers know that they might yet need to make use of a metaphoric get-away bag they keep under the bed.\nLikewise, while dating, we must make peace with ongoing singlehood in order to have the clarity to turn down person after person, date after date, who doesn’t attract or interest us sufficiently. Only if we can bear our own company will we avoid having to persuade ourselves of the rightness of the wrong people – and avoid letting the fear of dying alone spoil our lives.\nAt the same time, we will never be able to make peace with singlehood unless we move beyond one of the cardinal sentimental rallying cries of our age: that being single might be fun, fulfilling or interesting. So long as we continue with such bromides, we’ll suffer far more than we need to. Not only will we be alone, but we’ll feel ashamed at how awful it is to be so. We need to accept the truth unflinchingly: being single is horrible. Of course it is – boring, frightening, dispiriting and alienating.\nYet our very best chance of accepting and dealing adequately with singlehood is not to keep harbouring any illusions about it. There’s nothing interesting about having the whole bed to ourselves or being able to play music loudly at 3 a.m. The dating rigmarole is a fast route to mental exhaustion. But once we accept the bleakness, it will stop surprising or humiliating us at every turn.&nbsp;\nFor all its awfulness, singlehood is always better than the alternative: a bad relationship with an immature, shapeshifting, unself-aware, borderline person. It is better to be crying – yet again – on the living room floor, bemoaning our fate, than trying to get a recalcitrant, cheating, vain partner to come on board and love us properly. At least solitude doesn’t rob us of a future; at least, at all moments, it contains the possibility of something better.&nbsp;\nWe should hate being single very much – but we should also understand the extent to which enduring it soberly and steadily is the ultimate guarantor of the future we deserve.",

      "text": "It’s when a very meaningful relationship comes to an end that we stand to discover a highly peculiar fact about ourselves: our brains appear to have two separate centres of consciousness, which operate according to very different principles, are unable to share information properly, and don’t for a long time adjust to each other’s versions of the truth.\n\nPhoto by Victor G on Unsplash\n\nLet’s call one of these centres the logical mind. This part understands certain difficult things immediately and entirely: that someone has left us; that they treated us pretty shabbily; that for a long time, they didn’t let us know where we stood; that for ages when they were away last summer, they didn’t pick up our calls; that they flirted with other people online; that they’re rather hateworthy. And they are gone. We last heard from them months ago. There’s been total silence. They may well be deeply in love with someone else by now. \nBut then there is another part of the mind, let’s call this the emotional mind, that has a very different reading of things indeed – and refuses to readily accept very much that the intellectual mind might ever chose to tell it.\nThis part hears the logical mind well enough. It knows it’s saying: ‘It’s over. They were no good. They didn&#8217;t deserve you. It’s a waste of energy giving them another thought.’\nThey follow such words sentence by sentence, but then, when no one is looking, they repeatedly quietly slip off and go somewhere else entirely. Back to the evenings in Corfu when they held us tenderly and swore they would never let us go; over to an evening in Berlin when they sat in the chair opposite us reading and they appeared infinitely kind and thoughtful; back to the time when they cried telling us how lonely they’d been at primary school and we wanted so much to have been able to comfort them.\nThe emotional mind refuses to accept any of the carefully assembled evidence served up by its logical counterpart. It insists: they will return, even if they have blocked me across all devices. They love me, even if they are nowhere to be seen. They are my little baby, even if this very grown-up adult has evinced not the slightest bit of interest since they disappeared into the night with their belongings many months ago.\nDuring spare moments, the emotional mind loves to formulate all kinds of schemes that appal and frighten the logical mind. Why not hand deliver them a long letter? Why not go to their place of work and pretend to randomly bump into them in the lobby? Why not call their mother and argue the matter with her? Why not contact one of their friends? Why not pen them a long beseeching email telling them why they are ‘wrong’?\nTo each of these suggestions, the logical mind rushes to douse the flames. They may once have loved you, but clearly, they don’t any more. How could you ever feel safe around someone who did this to you? And the emotional mind listens politely, then turns away and begins humming again, thinking of baby’s sweet hands.\nThe emotional mind idealises. The ex was an intellectual colossus, a paragon of virtue and tenderness, the essence of kinky complicity. To which the logical mind struggles to add: and they were, above anything else, just another human being. And not an especially kind one at that, for what kind person leaves you with such immaturity in such a mess?\nBut the emotional mind is primitive; it doesn’t go in for nuances. They loved us once and told us it would be forever – so surely it will be. This mind isn’t arrogant, but it simply can’t see that someone would stop loving it if they once declared that they wouldn’t. It knows it wouldn’t appeal to everyone but once someone has been charmed, the expectation is that they will always remain on board. It has some of the fidelity and naivety of an infant waiting at the door for Mummy or Daddy to return, or a hunting dog, howling in a forest clearing, circling the putrefying body of its long-deceased owner.\nIt is this part of the mind that religions draw on. ‘My holy one is going to return’, it insists. One swathe of the population dreams of the return of their deity; the other, of their exes.\nEventually – let’s not put too fine a word on it – the logical mind realises that if it goes on like this, the whole system will go down; the entire host brain and body will succumb. So it stages some kind of intervention. It sounds the alarm, loud and clear. It forces a trip abroad to forget, or a visit to a psychiatrist.\nThere is an Arabic saying that the soul travels at the pace of a camel. In other words, one of the deepest distinctions between the logical and the emotional minds is how long it takes for information to properly enter them. The logical mind understands immediately: someone is dead, someone has gone, someone has ceased to love.\nBut eventually, it could be months or years after the logical mind first heard it, the news does finally start to make an impact, even on the recalcitrant folds of the emotional mind. The denial is no longer quite so vociferous. There are still intense flurries of love, but they are further apart and don’t last as long. After a long while, some kind of pact seems to be reached between the two minds. ‘OK,’ says the intellectual mind, ‘keep believing in them if you like, but in the meantime, could you accept dinner with someone else? Might we at least take a look at an app?’\nAt one level, the emotional mind will love forever. It’s just that other things will seize its attention. Memory will weaken. It will – blessedly – one day think of something else. And the logical mind will learn to be very, very careful with love going forward. It’s a thrilling force, this it will acknowledge, but it can also injure and maul us like nothing else ever can.",

      "text": "We are often reminded that – in our self-indulgent times – people tend to get out of relationships far too soon. Unprepared for the difficulties that come with living closely around anyone, aware of endless apparent alternatives, they grow impatient at the first signs of trouble and casually throw away what might have been highly functional and fulfilling unions. Love is not an emotion, these skittish people need to be reminded, it’s a skill; and one that – like violin playing or lace-making – requires a great deal of dedication and forbearance.\nAnd yet, when some of us look back at our lives, we may notice a rather different – though equally grave – problem: that we have been too good at patience and tolerance, that we have forgotten to notice our suffering and give it due weight, that we have extended inordinate understanding to behaviours that didn’t deserve our time and forgiveness – and that we have as a result wasted years, and possibly decades, of our very brief lives.\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Portrait of Yvonne Duchamp, c. 1907 or 1909\n\nIf we survey certain failed relationships with dispassion from the other side of heartbreak, the elements that undid us tend to have been there in nearly broad daylight from fairly early on. We tried to tell them (on that first weekend away) that their lack of overt affection left us frightened and uncertain of ourselves – and they grew offended, initially quietly, and then over the coming months with greater force, and so we learnt to keep quiet. Or when we mentioned that they needed to make more room for us in their lives alongside their friends, they kept going to parties without us anyway and accused us of being ‘possessive’ and ‘too needy’. Or when we asked if they might explore in therapy why they were so blocked in their career or over-concerned with their appearance, they grew sulky and said that we weren’t being ‘supportive’ and were too ‘strict’ in our requirements.&nbsp;\nNone of these tensions sounded fatal at the time. We took them in our stride. We put them down to the wear and tear of being with another human. It’s only now, from the stillness and defeat of our single state, that we can more firmly draw the connections between the final scenes and the early impasses. \nTo prevent ourselves from wasting yet more of our time in fruitless couplings, we should learn to ask ourselves a simple sounding but imperative question about any person we are attempting to build a future with: ‘When I complain to them, do they listen?’\nIn other words, when we bring them an issue that matters very much to us – that they should more clearly signpost their moods, that they should be more reliable in answering our messages, that they need to make us feel more valued alongside their friends – do they stop what they are doing, respond without defensiveness, ideally paraphrase what we’ve tried to tell them so that we know they’ve understood and then give us genuine signs that they are absorbing and acting on what we have said. Do they reply: ‘I hear that this matters to you. What I think you’re saying is that you’re feeling sidelined by my work …’ Or: ‘You’re telling me that my bad moods get in the way of you being able to express your needs …’ And then, in time, does something actually alter? Are there signs of progress? Are we overcoming challenges rather than just repeating them?\nThere are two important caveats to this golden question (‘When I complain to them, do they listen?’): firstly, we mean complaining about things of real significance, not whether they leave the bathroom in a mess or forget items on the shopping list. We mean major impasses around communication, sexuality, intimacy or kindness.\nSecondly, it matters immensely how we complain. It’s their responsibility to listen; it’s ours to speak with dignity, maturity and clarity. It doesn’t count if we do so late at night with raised voices, if we lace our complaints with insults, or if we belittle, nag or frighten. We also need to give them a great many chances. Not one or two or three. Let’s set the bar at an uncommonly high-sounding number: at least fifteen. Fifteen times we need to give them an opportunity to hear what we are telling them and change.\nBut if all this is in place and the frustrations nevertheless go on, we aren’t – by staying around – being mature or imaginative, therapeutic or fair-minded. We are delaying the inevitable. We will eventually be ruined anyway – ruined by our disloyalty to our insights. We will be undone by an over-developed sympathy for frustration. By doing nothing in the face of the golden question, we’re not changing what is going to happen; we’re merely speeding it up. We’re not in a functioning situation to begin with and may as well recognise the sombre truth right now. We aren’t helping our cause by hallucinating that we have found a solution when we haven’t. A relationship where one person doesn’t listen to another may survive for a while, even for a very long while; but it can never be safe, and it will never be a home. It’s bad enough that a relationship should be unviable. It becomes truly tragic when we continually deny that it might be so until it is too late to still try to make a life with someone who knows how to love like a grown-up.",

      "text": "It can take a very long time indeed for some of us to come to a highly basic-sounding realisation: we should only contemplate going out with people who are very enthusiastic about us. From the start. Without the need for persuasion. Without any call for begging or chasing or strategic withholding of affection or visits to therapy. Just plainly and simply keen, open and ready – from the get-go.\n\nPhoto by Frank Alarcon on Unsplash\n\nThis can sound extremely odd and, deep down, surprising, because so much in our culture and in our pasts fosters an altogether different kind of philosophy, to an extent that we may never quite have noticed.\nIn many cases, what we call love is really – upon examination – the business of overcoming obstacles and resistances to love. It’s precisely not about meeting up with someone who is already smiling at us and already on board. What we have understood by a ‘love story’ for the last two thousand years is essentially a study of one person – as keen as mustard – trying their very hardest to persuade another – disengaged and elsewhere – to look their way. The beloved is beautiful or dashing, brilliant and beguiling but there must always, according to the literary canon, be some substantial problem or another: they are married to someone else, they are devoted to God, they are too proud and defended to acknowledge their need for tenderness. What we call a plot is then the retelling of all the arduous steps that had to be taken in order that – a few pages from the end of the book or epic poem – the couple could finally be united and wedding vows exchanged. Love isn’t really love at all; it’s the delineation of the colourful obstacles to its realisation and enactment.\nThere is a more intimate counterpart to these epic tales of frustration in many of our psychological histories. Growing up, we may have first learnt about love from parental figures who were, in their way, every bit as unreliable, distracted and unfulfilling as any literary romantic paragon. These parental figures will not have been especially impressed by us, they might have kept their feelings guarded, they could have been addicted or depressed, they might have been living abroad or in love with someone else (perhaps one of our siblings, or a new spouse). And from this we will have derived a powerful impression that love – when it is real – must essentially be about unfulfillment and frustration, delay and resistance, about being made to feel unworthy and about being put on hold while someone we yearn for explores other options. Our most powerful experiences of love in childhood would have been about hoping against hope that someone we adored might eventually turn our way and think we were – after all, despite everything wrong with us – good enough.\nThe legacy of these two approaches to love can follow us – unconsciously – into the dating game. Here, we may notice nothing amiss in a prospective partner who tells us that they like us a lot but that they will only be available to see us again in a month, or someone who casually mentions they are presently trying to decide between us and three other suitors or a compelling career abroad. Or someone who can never bring themselves to initiate sex or hold our hand in public. A bit deeper into our relationships, we may similarly not spot that it might be less than ideal to be trying to convince someone that they should go to therapy so that they’ll (finally) see that they want us or that we are – in fact – just as much ‘fun’ to spend Saturday evenings with as their friends.\nTo cut through the nonsense, we may be in need of a robust awakening. So complicated and multiple are the requirements of a good life with someone (childcare, finances, sexual intimacy, friendship, etc.), the only person we should for a moment ever contemplate being with is someone who, at the start of the journey, can already be at the table with a conviction to match our own. \nWe can be forgiven for being – for a long time – deeply charmed by all the others: those who are coy and troubled, those who don’t reply to our messages, and those whose difficult childhoods render them enchantingly off-kilter. But this is a game we can, in the end, ill afford. We aren’t living in a novel, and we shouldn’t be trying to repeat our miserable childhoods or forgiving those of others. It isn’t love if you need to keep messaging and their phone is apparently always out of battery. It isn’t love if they are evasive or surreptitiously liking someone else’s posts. It isn’t love if they get defensive or describe our legitimate requirements for attention as ‘intense’. We need to get the wavering, defended ones out of our lives immediately; that will mean ejecting the majority of people we meet. All the more reason to focus on the very few with native enthusiasm. We need to hone our skills at recognising the keen ones and clear everyone else out of the way. If they don’t get back immediately, give up on them immediately. Stop imagining that they might be ‘shy’ or that you haven’t made your intentions clear enough. \nLet’s say it again for good measure: the only worthwhile lovers are those who don’t need persuading, those who like us a lot already, those who never leave us wondering where they might be or when they might reply, those whose commitment to us flows easily so that all the focus can be on the difficulties of day-to-day living. The others may be fascinating, lovely looking, about to change their minds in fifteen-and-a-half years after a trip to India, capable of generating lots of late-night arguments and ideal for a movie or psychoanalytic case study; they’re also just a plain waste of our precious time.",

      "text": "Louis-Léopold Boilly,&nbsp;Les Malheurs de l&#8217;amour&nbsp;(The Sorrows of Love), 1790\n\nIf we happened to pass this painting in its home – a crowded room in London’s Wallace Collection, that grand palace of art just north of Oxford Street into which we’d popped, with some misgivings, for half an hour to shelter from a spring storm – it would be unlikely to detain us long. The artist’s name would surely mean little to us; the style alienatingly aristocratic and fussy, probably an occasion for a pedantic lesson – another tedious artefact from a distant age, indifferent to our pressing confusions and longings.\nBut if we were to linger for a moment, we might just spot the title: Les Malheurs de l’amour or The Sorrows of Love. And here, perhaps, just perhaps, something might change. We might pick up on an unusually confident tone, resolutely universal in spirit, stepping without hesitation over the gulf in time and space (all the changes in clothes, manners and languages) in order to address us, me and you, human to human, in the here and now. Not ‘my sorrows’ or ‘your sorrows’ but ‘The Sorrows’ – as if everyone grown up knew what these terrible things were, as if all sensitive people understood that the business of love had its unremittingly agonising dimensions that deserved public rehearsal and commiseration.\nThe painting might not know about your particular griefs: the mess that followed N’s departure, the weeping in the bathroom, the unsent texts, the stillness of the weekends, the repeated sense of loss. But it’s unbothered by such local details. It feels able to speak heartbroken lover to heartbroken lover without getting bogged down in the minutiae of the 235-year age gap. It assumes we have all been shattered on similar rocks in comparable ways and always will; that we have all cried more or less the same tender, furious, bitter tears.\nThis is helpful precisely because – so often – our suffering is deepened by a sense that we are unusual and cursed to be feeling it. ‘It’ll pass,’ friends say. ‘Fall back in love with yourself,’ Instagram advises maddeningly. We seem to be the only ones crying beyond measure, the only ones mired in immature torment who can’t get this area of life right, the only ones who can’t recover our poise, even though it is now almost six months since they left. The painting starts somewhere else: all sensible and good people have come unstuck here, it’s no grounds for shame, love is simply nightmarish at moments.\nLike the greatest pop songs, the painting heads straight for the emotional nucleus. The lover has received some appalling news delivered, as is usually the case, with murderous politeness (‘I thought perhaps we might best honour our bond in a friendship going forward…’). And nothing will ever be the same again. Fuck him. She collapses into the arms of her best friend; we can almost hear the wailing above the hubbub of the gallery.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWe might smile, not because we don’t care, but because we feel so much less alone. It’s a delight that she’s so unremittingly upset. It’s so nice that she, too, is in such a mess. It probably began so nicely – as it tends to. He would have complimented her on her taste in poetry and suggested a walk in the gardens. The kind, polite ones are always the most dangerous. And then he was invited to a party and it all changed. There’s no more need for a stiff upper lip now. Under the painting’s aegis, we can throw off our normal reserve and maturity. This deliciously histrionic work – completed in a more earnest and emotional age – has no need for smart aleck irony or neat therapeutic resolutions. It’s happy to indulge in the full awfulness of the breakup without the slightest impulse to appear knowing or wise. It says: why not let the moment be as dramatic as it feels, why not give complete and proper license to the chaos, why pretend it isn’t exactly as dreadful as it is?&nbsp;\nThe painting does what all great art should do (and perhaps we can stop calling it great art and just think of it as useful art instead): it makes us feel less alone. It puts an arm around us and says, in effect, ‘I understand’. It’s our friend in the bleakest moments. It meets us in our sadness. There’s little more we could want from a picture. It might be the most helpful thing we’ve come across in a very long time.",

      "text": "The idea that we might, at points, need to create room for hatred – that mental well-being might rely on a selective time-bound capacity to hate certain people quite profoundly – may sound deeply implausible. Our world has long been steeped in notions of forgiveness and of the maturity of an empathetic mindset; the only associations we tend to have of hatred are of pathology and barbarism.\n\nPhoto by Donny Jiang on Unsplash\n\nBut this is to overlook that when people close to us do us wrong, it isn’t merely thoughtful or elevated to dismiss our injuries and turn away. This is to distort reality and drive a sickness into our bodies and our souls, from where we start to suffer from insomnia, depression, cynicism and impotence. We are so scared that hatred might be the last word on a situation that we forget to honour its legitimate role in any process of recovery. It is as psychologically mature to hate those who have injured us (and to notice cleanly and unambiguously that they have done so) as it is to know, at other times, how to recognise and accept tenderness.\nThere is nothing remotely vindictive or base about properly spotting that, for example:\n— someone hasn’t returned our generosity\n— someone has led us to believe in them and then callously let us go\n— someone has failed to show us gratitude \n— someone has discharged their sour, vindictive moods on us\n— someone was always too busy to take care of our needs\n— someone never listened\n— someone left our house in a mess\n— someone smiled at us for a long time and told us they adored us – only to quietly sell us a string of lies.\nIt isn’t peevish or unkind to spot all this and to baulk and curse, to condemn and insult. It belongs to a correct reading of reality and a quest to return to a balanced economy of good and evil.&nbsp;\nThe reason why some of us have such difficulty with this, and instinctively go mute and keep smiling, has very little to do with psychological evolution – and much to do, far more poignantly, with having been mistreated at our origins. Those who have been unable to identify their own early torment can subsequently have a very hard time feeling appropriately incensed.\nIt’s generally because we have – in our pasts – been constantly made to feel guilty and ashamed for what was not our responsibility that we now operate without an instinct for emotional self-preservation or a functioning compass of accountability. We have been schooled not to register the slaps we receive. We haven’t been loved enough to know how to name hatred.\nFor many of us, our childhoods gave us a lengthy covert education in not understanding who the villain might be. How could it be a parent who – though they entirely neglected us – nevertheless paid for nice holidays and good schools? How could we hate someone who deprived us of any intellectual self-confidence but was so obviously clever and revered by the people around them? What could we do if we were described as ‘bad’ and ‘selfish’ by someone much taller and more capable than us? How could we resent someone who was ill or addicted? These are not puzzles a small child is easily equipped to unpick.\nAs a result, for some of us, it will be the very last and most utterly implausible thought that someone else might have decided to inflict harm.\nThe problem with our instinctive forgiveness is what it does to our interiors. Hatred that hasn’t found its correct source doesn’t dissipate into lofty forbearance; it turns inwards and starts to gnaw at the spirit of its victims. If our parent isn’t bad, we must be. If an ex-lover isn’t to blame, we must be. If a friend can’t be at fault, we must be. We must be as ugly, guilty, deformed, awful and twisted as they are elevated, decent, committed and noble.&nbsp;\nWhatever the salutary role of self-criticism, there are a great many occasions when we should observe a simple truth: we have been done over and have every right to be livid. If we have been betrayed, we are right to be indignant. If someone left us without accounting for themselves, we have a right to resent them. If we were victims of meanness in childhood, it is part of health to feel offended.\nWe don’t need to stay in an angry space forever. There will be plenty of time – eventually – for serenity and complicated interpretations of why our enemies acted as they did. But this will only help if we have first been able to use expletives and throw something (soft) across the room and bang our fists and, if necessary, go to the basement or the forest and scream very loudly for a long time. This isn’t madness or a slide into immaturity. It is restitution and proportionate complaint. Hatred is not the end-goal of health; it may, for a time, be its only rightful and dignified means.",

      "text": "There’s one question that people who are deeply enmeshed in love – who might have been pursuing someone in vain for years or trying immensely hard to make a relationship work or pining for a partner who left them five years ago – seldom find the occasion to ask themselves.\nDespite a certainty that they are in love, the question they rarely pause to ask themselves is this: is the person I love nice to me?\nA lot of other things seem not to be in any doubt: that the person is amazing, that their name makes them jump, that they would give anything to be with them, that they think of them almost every minute of every day.\nBut what remains astonishingly unexplored is something more banal: are these people actually kind? Or, to expand, does this angel leave them feeling heard and seen? Does this amazing loved one have time for their sorrows and joys? Does this paragon of passion make them feel calm and safe? Are they happy in their presence?\n\nRamon Casas i Carbo, Interior in the Open Air, c. 1892&nbsp;\n\nAnd here, despite all the extraordinary devotion, the answer is liable to be rather confusing. It seems that this loved one – the recipient of so much care and passion, so much longing and devotion – isn’t necessarily especially kind back.\nThey may be grumpy, they may be unfaithful, they might not have been in touch for months or years. They may take ages to reply to a text message. They may prefer to go out with their friends and fail to invite their partner on holidays abroad.\nThis brings us to the ostensible paradox: why on earth does this flawed and cruel being elicit such care?&nbsp;\nAnd the answer is melancholy: the person is loved not despite their lack of kindness and reciprocity, but precisely because of it.\nWhy do some of us end up associating the word love with a lack of calm, an absence of generosity, a strong degree of disdain or disregard – and what’s more, not even notice that we do so?&nbsp;\nThe answer – as ever – lies in the difficulties of the past. There is a whole category of us who faced the following dilemma in childhood:\n1. We had parents who should have loved us.\n2. But they didn’t.\nAnd the clever way out of this dilemma was for us to reconfigure our assumptions and expectations. We dealt with a lack of affection from people who should have adored us by creating an association between love and absence; love and suffering; love and needing to do better; love and never knowing where one stands; love and hoping in vain for a better outcome.\nWe learnt to blame ourselves for others’ disregard of us. We learnt to be endlessly patient in the face of neglect. We learnt not to name hardness of heart. We learnt not to notice unfairness. We learnt to hope endlessly for a change of mind in the other person. We learnt to take blows on the chin.\nAnd now, in adulthood, it therefore doesn’t occur to us to call out bad behaviour as soon as it arises. We don’t register that we haven’t been happy in six months or ten years – or that the partner’s behaviour is mocking us grossly. Our response to someone ignoring us is to beg. Our impulse when a lover isn’t sure about us is to redouble our efforts to show them that we deserve to exist.&nbsp;\nOur own satisfaction doesn’t get a look in. We’re no more able now to ask, ‘Is the person I love nice to me?’ than we were at the age of five – and the answer in both cases would, of course, be ‘no’.\nWhat we should do instead needs – for some of us – to be stated very bluntly. However beautiful someone may be, however charming they might have been at the start, however theoretically clever they are, the only – and truly the only – basis on which we should be with anyone is if they are kind. That is if they are deeply thrilled to be with us, if they are extremely careful with our feelings, if they listen to our anxieties, if they respond without defensiveness to our complaints and if they are available to us when we need them.&nbsp;\nOtherwise, what we have on our hands is not a loved one, not someone who deserves our care, but simply someone who mirrors the same kind of intolerable and sadistic character we had to put up with as children.\nIf they aren’t sure they can commit, we shouldn’t be there. If they were once tender but no longer are, we shouldn’t be there. If they’d rather spend time with their friends than with us, we shouldn’t be there. If they don’t respond to our messages fairly fast, we shouldn’t be there. If they see us as an open wound and suggest we are ‘too much’, we shouldn&#8217;t be there. These things only seem very obvious to those of us who were loved properly at the start.\nLet’s state this as a very basic mantra: we should only love kind people. People who listen to us, are there for us and are committed to our welfare. Anyone else is not a candidate for love. They are a residue of trauma.",

      "text": "It would be natural to assume that luck was something it was very easy indeed to believe in: what could be more natural than to be hugely grateful and careful when – for example – one is given a break at work, or suddenly meets a truly loving and kind person, or falls in with a group of warm and supportive friends?\n\nGustav Klimt, Bauerngarten (Farmhouse Garden), c. 1905–1907\n\nBut to assume that any of this is necessarily straightforward to take on board and manage is to miss one of the great paradoxes of human nature. In truth, being able to believe in one’s luck – that is, being capable of cherishing the good things and people that fate and accident throw one’s way – belongs to a mighty psychological accomplishment, largely unconscious, which is dependent on a very specific path from childhood through to maturity.\nFor some of us, the lucky breaks – when they finally come along – far from being simple to assimilate and build upon, set off an insuperable background level of anxiety that may end up with us destroying much that we ostensibly want. At one level, we are, of course, grateful (how delightful that we now have some money or that there’s a very kind person in our lives), but at another, the goodness can be far too troubling and unfamiliar to internalise and cherish.\nWe need to look backwards to understand. Our whole lives may have been structured around the need to master deprivation and withstand horrific amounts of bad luck. Our personalities emerged from having to deal with the very opposite of good fortune: an angry father, a withholding mother, a jealous sister, a harsh school environment, a poor neighbourhood.\nWe adjusted well enough; we made our home among the ruins and the neglect. But it’s now precisely our skill at managing bad luck that makes the absorption of its opposite so tricky. When a person has to do everything to accommodate things that are so bad they shouldn’t be true but are, they will be at grave risk of disbelieving in good things that usually aren’t true but now happen to be so. Whatever their theoretical devotion to happiness, their equilibrium depends on ensuring a steady supply of pain.\nWe – the bad-luck-adapted ones – therefore have a horrifying habit (which we tend to notice only years after the event) of blowing up good fortune when it crosses our path. Without properly meaning to, we alienate the lovely new friends we have made. We annoy the bosses who believed in us. We get ourselves thrown out of the club that allowed us in. And – most tragically of all – we drive away (through bad moods and inconsistency, random accusations and unreliability) the uniquely kind and devoted lovers who wanted nothing more than to build a life with us.\nWe didn’t feel we deserved any of the blessings we stumbled on – and somehow made extremely sure we therefore wouldn’t have to bear them for long.\nIf we recognise any of ourselves in this sorrowful portrait, we need to take immense care not to destroy anything more of the beauty that life sends our way – at the same time as taking ample stock of the temptation. We suffered so much at our start; we cannot allow our powers of resignation and self-denial to rob us of any more of the gifts that fortune might yet throw our way.",

      "text": "The word ‘brutal’ may sound a little hyperbolic and self-pitying when applied to an activity whose chief outward requirements involve attending romantic restaurants, ordering olives, sharing small plates and – at points, perhaps – exchanging kisses near the bus stop. Those in couples, and especially those who have been in them a long time, can be forgiven for wondering what on earth the fuss might be about.\n\nPhoto by Daniel Silva Gaxiola on Unsplash\n\nHowever, for those of us who know the activity from the inside, who suffer from despondency and fury and may have found ourselves bursting into tears after yet another disappointment, the word ‘brutal’ may be an understatement. The reasons are multiple:\n— This isn’t just about an evening\nWhat is at stake extends far beyond a single encounter; this isn’t about the quest for an interesting conversationalist or a new sexual partner. It’s (generally) about the very long-term future; the acute question of who will be there when our heart spasms, when we are too frail to make it across the living room unaided and when we can barely remember our names. The evening, so innocuous in its outward form, so enlivened by the arrival of a smiling waiter (‘the bouillabaisse perhaps for sir or madam?’), is in essence a referendum on whether or not we must die alone. Beneath the outward lightness of the occasion (‘fries or salad?’) lies a piercing existential cry: when will I find a home?\n— The rise and fall of hope\nWe would never arrange a meeting without the thought that perhaps, just perhaps, we may now finally have stumbled on an answer. We know – or at least the sensible part of us does – that the odds are extremely slim. This exercise has probably been going on for months, maybe years. On so many occasions, we have set out into the night in our smart yet demure outfits, only to find, within a few minutes of the candidate’s arrival, that of course the photos were (again) deceptive, that their manner was very strange, their views on astrology maddening, their curiosity non-existent – and that the next forty minutes or three hours would be a polite hell haunted by the spectre of eternal solitude.\n— The million ways in which someone can be wrong\nOf course we don’t want to be fussy. It’s obviously not in our interest to keep spotting issues. But nor can we magically erase the doubts or the sexual or mental incompatibilities. It is hell because an urgent need for love collides with absurdly non-negotiable criteria for acceptance and an erratic flow of viable candidates. No wonder we may, despite our university degree and outward philosophic manner, end up on the bathroom floor in the foetal position screaming in incandescent sorrow to a non-existent god.&nbsp;\n— Our powerlessness\nOn the very rare occasions when we do find we like them quite a lot, the problems really start. They like us a lot too, really, they do, they enjoyed the evening so much. It’s just that they’re in a different place right now, they’re still finding their feet after the breakup, their children need extra attention, they’re starting to think that polyamory might be for them at this point&#8230; And of course we’re so understanding, it would be such an honour to be their friend or occasional sexual playmate, but can we really be condemned if, after the twentieth time of this, we were to push back our chair, fall to our knees, cover ourselves in a plate of tahini or garlic mayonnaise and attempt to impale ourselves on the bread knife in front of our stunned fellow diners and the puzzled waiting staff.\n— It’s every rejection you’ve ever had\nIt may seem to be only about Abda from Mumbai or Sophie from Peckham, but deep down, it’s also about our awful mother who was never there, our father who bullied us, the people who hated us at school and the partner who left us ambiguously after a five-year relationship we did everything to save. Everyone tells us it’s not personal, but our unconscious knows better. It couldn’t be more fucking personal. This is the universe reconfirming its fundamental verdict on us: we are a piece of vermin, and the gods are vengefully urinating on us from on high.\n— Rejecting is as bad as being rejected\nWorse still, we can’t comfortably play the victim for long, because even as we process our rejections, we are called upon to perform an equal or greater number of our own assassinations, talking sweetly to unsuitable suitors about our busyness and hopes for warm friendships. We can’t – in the midst of our ordeals – even think of ourselves as particularly nice.\n— Exhaustion\nWe’re so tired, even though – ostensibly – we haven’t done very much at all. We’re tired of our uncertain destinies, of repeated encounters with our unbudgeable fussiness, of the wrongness of everyone, of our mental instability, of the hours lost to swiping and of the continuous cycles of felling and being felled. What is so awful about us? Who did we kill in a previous life? Why is everyone either unavailable or unappealing? Why is this so hard? Where are they? How can we find the strength to keep going? We’re two bad dates away from a locked ward. We haven’t just been out for dinner. We haven’t just met someone for a chat. We’ve once again attempted to find a respite from cosmic alienation – and failed. We deserve a lot of understanding – and, ideally, before much longer, when they finally stop laughing up there on Mount Olympus, some sort of a lucky break.",

Why so much love? Why this bear and none other?&nbsp;\n\nWhat soon emerged was sombre and moving: children tend to have a lot of love for their bears when, in a variety of ways, the surrounding environment lacks love.&nbsp;\nChildren who grow up in entirely well-adjusted families seldom get deeply attached to bears; people suffice. And correspondingly, the greater the deprivation, the more fanatical the devotion can be.&nbsp;\n\n\nWe marvelled at the ingenuity of the child’s mind.

It will correctly gauge the specific shortfall of affection, then project it into an inanimate object – and from here beam it back to itself. \n\nWe noted the specificity: the boy deprived of a father will find a mouse he can father. The girl lacking hugs will identify an especially huggable bunny. It made us think of religions; how humans invent gods to soften the absences of earthly life. Our bears were talismanic deities.

      "text": "In the pantheon of modern villains of love, there is one character who stands out as worthy of particular condemnation: the fiend who starts a new relationship while still not fully over their ex. The complaints against this appalling figure are legion: why are they wasting everyone’s time? Why such selfishness and deceit? What amoral and disgusting behaviour to show up at love’s door like this. Why not just wait?\nThe outrage is easy to sympathise with (especially if we, or someone we care about, has ever been on the receiving end of the damage that can ensue in some of the more extreme cases). The problem is that pure outrage has very little to teach us. We end up abundantly certain about what people should not do, and yet without much clue as to why they sometimes do it anyway.\nThe reality is that for some of us (who aren’t necessarily outright monsters), there may not always be a choice between getting over a past relationship on the one hand and starting a new relationship on the other. Such is the grief that we’re mired in, such is the hold of sentiment and nostalgia; the only plausible way we can begin to overcome the legacy of an old person may – gingerly and soberly – be to try to connect with a new one. We could otherwise have waited for five or five hundred years in a room on our own without ever making progress; the sole realistic way of staunching our wound is to love again.\n\nHenri Martin, A Couple Walking Along the Luxembourg Basin, 1932–1935\n\nThis isn’t, of course the neat scenario that moralists like to believe in, but the difficulty with moralism is that it raises the burden of honesty to such a degree that it more or less forces people to end up in deceptions. Why wouldn’t a heartbroken person be tempted to lie about their state when the alternative would be to condemn themselves to a permanently solitary future?\nParadoxically, the more two lovers can bring themselves to share and listen to their complicated realities, the more fidelity stands to increase. Relationships – at their most noble – should be about making room for the less edifying aspects of being human: the bits we wish weren’t there, but are. Lovers become more solid, rather than less so, as they confess without too much fear (and with all the necessary caveats) that they still have confusing feelings for someone else, or indeed that they are sometimes angry or sad or jealous or inadequate. The more we allow someone to be who they are, the more our bond with them deepens. ‘So, tell me more about your ex. It sounds sad, but interesting,’ might be the question that – more than any other – allows someone to love afresh and, ironically, move on decisively from a troublesome ghost.\nGood parents are aware of the benefits of allowing tricky truths into the light. They know that if they remain calm when a child says that they sometimes think Mummy is a horrible cow or that they want Daddy dead, this isn’t a prelude to delinquency or mass murder. It’s just a passing articulation of ambivalence which, if it can be accommodated without weakness or fury, will help a small person to feel seen and loved.\nNaturally, in a perfect world, no one would ever have any feelings of any kind for an ex – just as no one would ever fancy the waiter, flirt with a stranger or wish for a few moments to abandon the partner they adore.\nBut in this world, so long as complex feelings are expressed with sanity and respect, it may be highly conducive to love that they should be listened to with imagination. What love properly aims at is a mutual, kindly forgiving acknowledgement of all the stranger aspects that come with being human. The people we properly love are those who allow us to explain who we are without judgement or fury. For them, we’ll reserve our deepest loyalty; for them, we’ll do our utmost to become the pure, uncomplicated people we long to be.",

      "text": "There’s a common assumption that the only way to own a beautiful house, or car or piece of clothing is to&nbsp;buy&nbsp;it. That is: to slide across a very large sum of money in order to be declared, according to the instruments of modern law, its rightful owner.\nIn the background, a vast practical and theoretical system exists to promote this point of view, made up of economists, lawyers and accountants and also, and as importantly, an ideology that associates the best life with spending every minute of every day in pursuit of a fortune that will make legal ownership of expensive things possible.\n\nPhoto by Ярослав Алексеенко on Unsplash\n\nIt seems to make a great deal of sense, until we hit on a highly idiosyncratic psychological truth: that whatever the principles of legal ownership might suggest, to truly ‘own’ something isn’t to have its title deeds; it’s to think about it. We possess something first and foremost when it’s in our thoughts, when we turn it over constantly in our minds, when we appreciate its qualities, when we can imaginatively run over its surfaces, when its virtues are firmly known to us. Just as we don’t really possess a thing any more – whatever the law may say – if we never think about it, if it never crosses our minds, if we pay it no attention, if we have entirely ceased to appreciate it, if our spirit is too mired in envy, fear or sadness to allow us to give it in any mental space.\nWhat we are defining are two principles of ownership. On the one hand, ownership based on a legal right; on the other, ownership based on appreciation. And, the proposal goes, the entirely neglected second principle may in reality be the far more powerful and operative of the pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nThe penniless scholar who devotes every moment to thinking about a particular painting by Matisse may – in this light – be far more its true possessor than someone who – after a flourishing career in the aluminium industry – buys a work, puts it in the dining room of a palace they rarely go to and doesn’t think about it ever again. Likewise, the person who truly owns the elegant house in the suburbs of Marrakech isn’t the one whose name is on the title deed so long as when they are there, all they do is plot the downfall of their enemy, worry about their resentment at ill-treatment by a rival or cannot surmount their sadness at being overlooked for a promotion. It’s the one who has noticed the elegant brickwork on the facade, the delicacy of the columns in the hallway and the charms of the tilework in the bathrooms.\nThrough the subversive lens of ‘imaginative ownership’, some very rich people could suddenly appear very ‘poor’. Just as some very indolent people, who didn’t work hard at school and spend their time leafing through postcards and gazing at free pictures online, might suddenly emerge as the surprising ‘owners’ of huge tracts of the world.\nOf course, legal ownership may well be accompanied by a healthy degree of imaginative ownership. There are plenty of financially wealthy people who spend a lot of time appreciating what they legally possess. But at the same time, we must concede that there is no necessary and sufficient connection between ownership and appreciation.&nbsp;\nTo follow the logic to its extreme, it may be possible to ‘steal’ someone’s house not by wresting the legal deeds from them by chicanery or violence, but just by sitting outside the property and meditating on its virtues with discipline for a concentrated period. The most effective ‘thieves’ aren’t the ones who strip people of material possessions (they may just be falling into the same materialistic trap as their victims), it’s the ones who quietly and harmlessly sit down and think about the beauty of what they desire.\nAnd we know this because – however modest our means – we are probably all already guilty of ‘owning’ far less than we actually possess. It’s liable to have been a very long time indeed since we properly appreciated the vase we once bought on holiday, or looked at many of the art books on our shelves, or marvelled at the sunlight on our kitchen wall, or indeed, noticed the beauty of the tree out in the yard, let alone the astonishing nature of being alive on this peculiar fragile planet nestling in a forgotten corner of a boundless universe. We let most of what we have slip through our fingers, whether we legally own fabulous bits of real estate or just our own more modest dwellings.\nThere is no use striving for more so long as our mechanisms of appreciation are unable to absorb what we already have. Alongside our material efforts, we must therefore strive – always – to notice what is right now to hand – before death comes along at its chosen hour to prise it from us in its usual blindly insistent and merciless way.",

      "text": "Thinking about the age of the earth is – unexpectedly perhaps – among the more consoling and calming of all activities.\nBut it’s worth registering that for most of history, we humans had a poor sense indeed of how old the earth might be. Until the modern era, the leading minds of the Western world took their cue from the Bible and counted 76 generations between Adam and Christ (from Adam to Noah was 10, Noah to Abraham another 10, Abraham to David, 14 and so on) &#8211; which led to the confident notion that the earth must be around 4,000 years old.\nThen, over the course of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, people started to look with new eyes at what had always lain before them – and had another think. They studied mountains, craters, cliffs and small creatures trapped in layers of rock and began to form very different conclusions. A vertiginous feeling descended. History might be far, far longer than anyone had assumed – and we humans hadn’t been around for most of it. There had been worlds before our world, long periods when there were seas where there are now suburbs and tropical forests where there are now frozen wastes. Unimaginably strange creatures had once walked the earth: the therizinosaurus, a towering theropod with enormous scythe-like talons from the Late Cretaceous period; the chalicotherium, a peculiar, knuckle-walking vegetarian mammal, which resembled a horse but had long, curved claws with which to pull down tree branches and the deinocheirus, a lumbering, humpbacked dinosaur with a pot-bellied frame, massive arms, and a duck-like beak.\nThe more scientists and geologists researched, the more ancient and weird everything seemed to get. In 1650, English Archbishop James Ussher had staked his professional reputation on the idea that the world had been created in precisely 4004 BC. By 1779, the naturalist Comte de Buffon, after researching cooling rates of molten rock, proposed that the planet was actually 75,000 years old. By 1830, the geologist Charles Lyell, influenced by his study of processes of erosion and sedimentation, argued for a then-astonishing 4 million years. By 1862, the physicist Lord Kelvin, using thermal calculations, came to 400 million years. By 1907, with the discovery of radiometric dating, scientists revised the estimate to at least 2 billion years. And by the mid-20th century, improved radiometric techniques led to a figure of 4.5 billion years old – which remains, for now, the settled number.\n\nA sample of gneiss rock from the Acasta River area of Canada, 4.03 billion years old\n\nWhat had once seemed like an unchanging, juvenile world emerged as a place of incomprehensible antiquity. The realisation felt both profoundly humbling – and, in its way, deeply reassuring, for it served to shrink to far more manageable dimensions the significance of those most wretched and ephemeral of creatures: ourselves. Far from dominating history with our crises, arrogance and vanity, it seemed we were – in fact – just a very minor moment in a story of infinitely greater grandeur and significance. What matter our romantic failure in the context of that vast supercontinent Pangaea, which once held nearly all of Earth’s landmass and had begun breaking apart around 200 million years ago or that even older supercontinent, Rodinia, that existed over a billion years ago, and triggered an ice age so extreme that glaciers may have reached the equator. Why be quite so bitter over our professional disappointments when over a hundred million years ago, Antarctica was covered in conifer forests. Or why lose sleep over a rumour when more than 90% of the Earth’s history had passed before the first flower bloomed.\nReligions had once urged us to remind ourselves of the non-human divine realm by placing images of the Virgin Mary or the Buddha around our homes. To follow the spirit of their example, we might place somewhere in the kitchen a fragment of banded ironstone, formed 2.5 billion years ago, when the first oxygen-producing bacteria rusted the seas and turned the oceans red. Or a picture of a piece of 4-billion-year-old Acasta Gneiss rock, forged in the planet’s infancy when its surface was still a hellscape of fire and impact craters.\nWhen we are told by science that a bird is not simply a bird, but the lingering echo of a long-extinct dinosaur or that an eye took half a billion years of blind trial, we may feel all our certainties start to wobble. Our plans, daily urgencies and minor hopes seem newly absurd. Our finger nails are the ghosts of claws we no longer need; the clouds above are ancient molecules of water, carried here by asteroids – and nothing makes sense any more. How hard it is to stay outside the human frame for any length of time. Like astronauts on a spacewalk, we have only a few moments before we need to get back to more familiar settings.\nAnd yet there is an enduring lesson here that we need to keep rediscovering: that nothing matters as much as we fear. Or, to echo a piece of religious wisdom whose relevance will never cease: that, blessedly, this too shall pass.",

      "text": "There’s a bitter paradox that awaits many of us who have suffered from harsh, unloving childhoods: we have an above-average chance of ending up in, and blindly putting up with, harsh, unloving relationships. Our original unfulfilling bond to our caregivers – far from warning us away from future turmoil – appears to compel us to recreate its features in adult life. The true toll of bad childhoods isn’t circumscribed to their actual duration; it’s exacted via a lifelong search for their sad echoes. We suffer from an instinctive pull toward dimly familiar forms of mistreatment and struggle. We unconsciously gravitate toward situations that mirror our early wounds. Like everyone else, we want love to take us home: it’s just that for us, home was a place of grief and persecution. \nIt’s easy enough to see why children put up with poor treatment. They are born radically powerless. They cannot run away, they are utterly at the mercy of others, they can’t even think especially straight. What they must do above all else is adapt.\n\nEl Greco, Detail from Saint Francis of Assisi, c. 1580\n\nWhich in practice means learning to put up with poor treatment. They have to develop an advanced skill at not noticing quite how awful things are; an expertise at being unfazed by cruelty and neglect.\nChildren in deprived circumstances tend to be geniuses at looking away, disassociating and making light of things. Of course it might not be perfect that their father screams at them constantly, but there are some interesting shows on television and there’s a really fascinating bit of the garden to explore in the morning (you can climb up the big tree and imagine it’s a little house). And of course ideally their mother wouldn’t be so mocking and disloyal but that’s just the way things are; neither more or less sad than the fact it’s often raining and there’s a lot of homework to do.&nbsp;\nIn any case, the bad treatment almost certainly has to do with something that they – the child – have done wrong. Badly treated children tend to take a compulsively generous view of those who injure them. Obviously they aren’t nasty on purpose. That would make no sense. Clearly their ostensible brutality has sound explanations. It must be because they, the child, is in the wrong. That’s why they’re being neglected. That’s why they’ve been declared fools. That’s why they are being bullied. It’s a great deal easier to believe that the parent is tough yet fundamentally right – rather than gratuitously callous and unjustifiably hostile.&nbsp;\nIn other words, what a bad childhood trains us to do above all else is to indulge meanness. The muscle that normally functions to repel attacks has had to be starved and has atrophied. In order to survive, we had to lose the ability to work out who was good and bad for us – lest we discover that we spent 18 years in the company of fiends.\nWhat this means for our futures is that we will be extremely poor at discerning when the partners we let into our lives cross the border into selfishness and malevolence. We’ll continue under a narcoleptic command not to notice that we are being robbed and deceived. We’ll be as blind to the blows now as we were then.\nFor a long time, it simply won’t occur to us to wonder why we have ended up paying for everything for the partner, or why they are unreliable in their promises or constantly prioritise their friends over us or are angrily defensive whenever we raise a complaint.\nWe will simply – as we had to early on – fall into line and invent elaborate explanations for their behaviour: they are good, but they are tired. They are adorable, but under pressure at work. They are fierce but compensating for their childhood traumas (for which we have a lot of sympathy). Anything other than the more straightforward conclusion: we have fallen in with unconcerned egoists.\nWe should not compound our disloyalty towards ourselves by feeling – on top of everything else – ashamed for our tolerance. It isn’t weakness, it’s a survival strategy from childhood that served a very sensible purpose then but is liable to be ruining our lives now.\nTo wake ourselves up, we need to consider our choices as if someone else had made them. We might wonder what we would advise a friend to do if they were in our situation. And through such a lens, we might start to perceive that the treatment we are facing isn’t – as we have long thought – a sign of our partner’s depth or complexity but in the end, something much more humble: evidence that we need to get away.&nbsp;\nBut this will only be a momentary liberation until we can understand the more fundamental issue: that the muscle most people use to eject poison has withered because of a distinctive history.&nbsp;\nWe need to reverse the direction of our psychological fate: our early suffering should not condemn us to yet more pain, it is what gives us an specially powerful claim on original sources of kindness, tenderness and calm.",

      "text": "It can be hard to know what to do next in relation to many challenges we face. Maybe we’ve left our partner in a painful breakup. Now what should happen? Should we look for someone else? Should we spend time alone? Should we even try to go back to our ex? Or maybe we have difficulty with a senior colleague at work. Do we confront them? Or say nothing? Or move company?\nIn order to help us with such confusions, it pays to turn to a basic but highly effective thought experiment. We should pause to ask ourselves the following: ‘If my life were a film, and I was its central character, what would the audience want me to do next?’\nThe reason why such a question can yield especially lucid results is that it automatically clears up a many of the biases and blind spots that ordinarily mar our judgement. The familiar structure of films, ingrained in us since childhood, has a particular power to counteract our self-defeating impulses.\n\nPhoto by Noom Peerapong on Unsplash\n\nFor a start, films have central figures that we love. We tend to deeply admire the hero and heroine. We want them to get out of whatever scrape or misery they are in – and we long for them to make the most of their lives. We’re properly on their side – in a way we’re frequently not quite on our own.\nSecondly, we can’t bear reversals and meaningless detours. It’s agonising to watch a character we like make an error, go back on an ideal, betray themselves or sink further into bitterness or self-hatred. ‘No, no, don’t do that,’ we may whisper quietly to ourselves from the middle of the back row.\nThirdly, however patient we may be with some of the longueurs typically associated with art-house cinema, we want things to happen in films. We don’t want to waste time, we get restless and increasingly desperate about indolence and prevarication. It’s no fun watching someone we care for turning around in circles. ‘Come on!’ we may whisper again from the back.\nIn other words, we are often far more adept at discerning the best choices for a fictional character than for ourselves.&nbsp;\nAs we think about what we might do in the film of our lives, certain options immediately appear a great deal more viable – and others less so. Of course the audience wouldn’t want us to go back to our ex. They saw the arguments, they were horrified by the final scene in which they didn’t even say a proper goodbye and left the house in chaos. They would wince and scream at the idea of us suggesting a meeting with them – or even of sending them a message. And of course the audience wouldn’t want us to appease our arrogant colleague. They’d want us to request a meeting, tell them what’s on our mind and walk away with dignity.\nWe should learn to perform systematic audits of our dilemmas through a cinematic lens:\n— If my love life were a film, what would happen next?\n— If my career were a film, what would happen next?\nAnd so on.\nIt’s a humbling thought: that most of the information we need to make judicious choices is in us already; it just remains inaccessible to us due to an accumulation of self-hatred and under-confidence. We know deep down what we should do. We simply haven’t – as yet – been generous enough to imagine ourselves as the purposeful protagonists of our own stories.",

We may expect a little friction here and there, some misunderstandings and the odd bit of egoism but in essence, we expect people to be good; as good as we are.\nAnd on the whole, our optimism serves us very well indeed. It means we can make friends with ease, trust colleagues, create bonds with strangers, defer to figures of authority and enter with hope into relationships.\nThe problem is that this very trust, so handy in almost all cases, has a power to lull us – at a few critical junctures – into extremely consequential forms of blindness and error.\nVery rarely but nevertheless very significantly, someone may enter our lives who is seismically dangerous, someone who is deep down extremely unwell and compelled to externalise their sickness by harming others. It may be only every decade, it might be only once in our entire lives, but given the scale of the danger, that is enough. They will enter – and, like a virus against which we have no immunity – overrun us and exact an enormous price for our innocence and benevolence. \n\nActor Fritz Gerstmann as Iago in a production of Shakespeare&#8217;s Othello, c. 1940. In Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#8217;s words, Iago possesses a &#8216;motiveless malignancy&#8217; – and would probably be labelled a &#8216;sociopath&#8217; today. \n\nNothing in our experience will have readied us for what trouble looks like up close. We’ll have no clue as to how to defend ourselves against an enemy who beats all our assumptions about how others might behave. Probably, the dangerous person will wear a charming exterior. We underestimate how subtle are the signs of pathology. The truly disturbed &#8211; those who ruin people and nations – can be highly adept at feigning normalcy, at exercising charm, at making us feel at ease around them and at spending what might be years winning us over to their cause.\nA huge degree of trust may have been built up before we have any inkling of what is at play: that we have unwittingly given over our lives to what we can – for once – utterly legitimately think of under that dramatic-sounding term: sociopath.\nStill the bad news may have enormous trouble reaching our deep minds. Surely this cannot be happening, it can’t be that we would have married such a person, that this person might be the parent of our child, that we would have signed over most of our worldly belongings to them, that we might have voted them into office or given them unlimited powers over us. Surely this can’t be the same person who was – at the start – immensely sweet and has such an innocent or weak-seeming or ebullient manner. Surely, on an ordinary seeming sunny day, evil can’t be unfolding in front of us.\nPart of being a responsible adult is to balance two very confusing and dramatically opposed ideas: almost all the time, in almost all contexts, people will be extremely nice: reasonable, measured and well-intentioned. And then occasionally, very occasionally, someone extremely unhinged will try to ruin everything.&nbsp;\nIn order to wake up in time, we have to carve out a conceptual space: there is such a thing as mental illness, there are sociopaths at large, they cannot be appeased and they can kill us. There is no reason why, despite all the benign times we have gone through, something very sick shouldn’t emerge. We may, to save ourselves, need to draw on all our latent reserves of fortitude, cynicism, and anger – and fight to build a very sturdy moat around ourselves. We can, and must, live with hope. We can’t ever (again) allow ourselves to be innocent.",

Or falling over trying to open the bathroom door with their foot and their scarf. Or scrambling for their shoes to cross the hotel room floor or trying to edge their passport into a plastic bag for later fumigation after it was lightly touched by the immigration official.\nSome of our mirthful disdain comes from a sense that the germaphobe isn’t being honest with themselves or the world. Something is up but it can’t possibly be what they claim: door handles and handshakes simply aren’t that risky. In other words, we sense, perhaps rightly but with harshness, that the idea of a ‘germ’ has come to stand in for something else, that it’s a cover for some other concern hovering just off stage. They may be scrubbing away trying to expunge something; it’s just not what they tell us it is.\n\nPhoto by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on Unsplash\n\nBut, to extend compassion, what might the germaphobe essentially and unconsciously be worried about if it isn’t germs themselves? Three fears can be said to haunt them. A fear of their own unacceptable sides. A fear of infringement by other people. And a fear of the unknown and the uncontrollable.\nIn the past of many germaphobes, there was likely to have been a parent who could not accept the full reality of the person they had brought into the world. Everything that was less than pristine had to be censored. There would have been constant reminders to stay clean, a lot of anxiety around the potty and flinches every time the child came in from the garden to the parent for a hug. From this, the child would have derived a subtle sense that there was something _ quite what might have been unclear _ unclean and unacceptable about them, something that could not be borne by their caregivers, sides of their nature that had to remain under wraps or exiled lest the child be abandoned or labelled abhorrent. In their constant efforts to rid themselves of germs and expel contaminants, we can read an ongoing attempt to prove their own loveability and good nature to a rejecting punitive internalised parental figure.\nGermaphobia is also likely to hint at past invasion, not by microbes, but by people who didn’t respect boundaries; who disturbed the germaphobe’s mind or touched their body, who went where they shouldn’t have done and upset the due order of things. Germs stand in for everything that wasn’t originally in the right place, for what ruined purity, for those who didn’t listen to a ‘no’.\nIn germaphobia, we glimpse too a terror at unpredictability. Dirt in the wrong place stands as an emblem of everything that might happen when it shouldn’t; it is a death, a departure, a divorce, an outrage. One tidies and tidies to keep a tenuous hold on fragile order in an overwhelming chaotic unbounded world.\nThe tribulations of germaphobes should be a conduit for gratitude at our own relative good fortune. If we don’t need to aggressively ward off the less than clean sides of us, if we can bear a little ‘dirt’, if it’s fine to leave a few used dishes by the sink overnight, it is because someone early on was generous enough to accept the less than pristine sides of our natures, psychological as much as physical. They were not disgusted by us – so that we, in turn, now have no need to be disgusted by ourselves. Stability and sanity aren’t threatened by a finger mark or a dirty glass because they existed sufficiently strongly at the start and promise to continue to do so into the future.\nGermaphobes aren’t ever really responding to dirt; rather to an absence of love and safety. Once we have finished mocking them for their cleanliness, we can take pity on them for their pain.",

      "text": "We should start with a large caveat; one person’s ‘hoarding’ is another person’s ‘collecting’ or ‘not throwing things randomly away’ or ‘being grateful for one’s possessions.’ But when every polite explanation has been given as to why someone has developed an advanced interest in archiving everything, we have to accept that there are cases where proportion has definitively vanished, where there are towers of newspapers blocking the hallways, the cupboards no longer open and the kitchen is clogged with containers from a decade’s worth of takeaway dinners.\n\nPhoto by Lucia Sorrentino on Unsplash\n\nThe phenomenon of hoarding throws into relief the sheer psychological achievement behind ordinary disposal. What health to conclude that we probably won’t need the box that the hairdryer came in; and that though they were once beautiful, we won’t realistically have any further use for the old jumpers with the moth holes in them – and that though there may have been one or two articles in them we missed, we can do without last year’s fast yellowing magazines. Health brings with it a sense of probability, of what is more or less likely to be important going forward. And behind this, we can detect a confidence about our capacity to discern value; a working sense of what the world is liable to be like and who we’ll want to be in it.\nBy contrast, the unfortunate hoarder is afflicted by a radical uncertainty as to their own wants and ultimately, as to their own identities. There tends here to be a past (as with most mental troubles): often impatient, easily-angered parents who gave a child a feeling that they didn’t understand much and mattered even less; that certain things were extremely important and others not – but without there being any additional explanations for what the operative logic might be. \nThe child would from this have developed an association between making a decision and running grave risks. To choose will have become associated with a terror of setting off fury, vindictiveness or abandonment. The hoarder may, in other areas, now have difficulty deciding what job to do, what partner to choose, what clothes to wear or restaurant to book. Anticipating others’ needs has become the alternative to the impossible business of fathoming one’s own; keeping all options open the alternative to the torment of making a decision.\nHoarding can be motivated too by a fear of loss, precipitated by an actual grave experience of loss. By holding on to everything, the hoarder hopes that no further important things will be thrown away. It may have been material things that vanished long ago, probably in childhood. But it’s far more likely to have been metaphorical, emotional ones that are driving the behaviour. Perhaps the hoarder once enjoyed parental warmth and then a sibling was born. Or a parent died. Or abuse began. By clinging to old batteries or socks, files and stamps, the hoarder is confusedly striving to prevent yet more emotional privations.\nRather than pushing the hoarder to ‘tidy up,’ we might ask them, with greater compassion and far greater utility: what might you once have lost that mattered to you deeply? As often with mental unwellness, the sufferer may have no conscious idea. And yet if one can – thanks to psychotherapeutic introspection – remember the sibling who shifted a parent’s attention, or the baby who died in pregnancy, it may become less important to preserve every last shoe box or spent printer cartridge. \nThe solution to compulsive hoarding isn’t to learn to throw things away; it’s to understand what has already been taken from us emotionally. What hoarders are covertly trying to preserve, against the backdrop of difficult unremembered pasts, are not belongings at all – rather a sense of worth, a mood of safety and a feeling of love.",

      "text": "It is a measure of how much we generally manage to keep political events separate from our internal functioning that it sounds unusual, and possibly eccentric, to speak of such events as having any power to ‘drive us mad.’ Of course we may sometimes sigh at our screens and let out an expletive or two at a given situation in the company of a friend, but somehow ‘madness’ – that truly extreme state in which we lose a grip on the functioning of our minds, in which we can no longer contain our anxieties or retain perspective – feels exaggerated in relation to political events that do not personally touch us, when no bomb is directly falling on us and no tyrant is explicitly sending us to prison. We associate sanity with not going mad even when the world does appear – some miles away from us, in its own way – to have gone a little mad.\nBut if things are pressing on us with particular force, perhaps more than is generally held to be legitimate, we might turn to the writer Virginia Woolf, one of the most sensitive humans ever to have lived, who did – it seems – lose control of her mind, and eventually of her life, over the rise of fascism in Germany and the outbreak of the Second World War. \n\nPhotograph of Virginia Woolf, 1902\n\nWoolf had not been mentally well for a long time. She had been sexually abused by her half brothers from the age of six until late adolescence, she had lost her mother at the age of 13, her beloved half sister at 15 and her father at 22. It is no wonder that the world did not feel quite safe, that she was often terrified, that she internalised what was done to her by imagining herself a terrible person and that she had great difficulty trusting that anyone could be kind, reliable or properly on her side. At the same time, her challenges gave her an enormous appetite for beauty, for gentleness, for friendship, for literature and for compassion and sympathy. She held on extra tightly to what felt ‘good’ outside to make up for all that was frightened and hurt inside.\nIt is this faith that Hitler, a stranger living far away in another land, destroyed for Virginia Woolf. His aggression, his hate-filled and untruthful speeches, his control over the minds of Germans wore away at Woolf’s trust in everything. He seemed to paint the world black and removed the hope that she had always already found in short supply. His cruelty echoed too much that had been cruel in her life. \n\nPromotional photographs of Adolf Hitler demonstrating favourite &#8216;poses&#8217;, 1930\n\nThe invasion of Poland and then France and all of Western Europe, the beginning of the Blitz and U-boat campaigns chiselled away at the foundations of her belief in reasoned and principled behaviour. The world had lost its way and Woolf could not prevent herself from following suit. She tried very hard to stop the fears, the voices, the anger and distress but despite the love of her husband, the safeguards gradually fell away. On March 28, 1941, following a particularly senseless and destructive German air raid on London, she filled her coat pockets with stones and walked into the River Ouse near her home in Rodmell, Sussex. Her body was found three weeks later.\nBefore drowning, she left a letter to her husband: ‘I feel certain I am going mad again. I feel we can&#8217;t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan&#8217;t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can&#8217;t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness… I don&#8217;t think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can&#8217;t fight any longer… Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness.’\nIt seems peculiar to think of Virginia Woolf as one of the victims of Nazism. After all, none of Hitler’s furious speeches targeted her, no Luftwaffe raid gunned for her and yet in a sense, the atmosphere of mayhem and unbounded violence generated by Hitler and his gang were to blame for unbalancing the fragile mind of possibly the greatest writer of the twentieth century, living in a quiet English village far from any bomb or concentration camp.\nWoolf’s case stands as a warning – and a reminder of susceptibility. For those of us who are not wholly steady inside, whose minds have been placed under enormous stress by early losses and abuses, what happens in the political realm is not as distinct from us as it might be and may prove especially charged and especially dangerous. The hateful voices and motives we see faraway can’t help but evoke those we have known too well from our vicinity and that we have fought for many years to keep at bay. We may have a special need, more than we realised, for the world to show evidence of solidity and goodness to counterbalance the violations of the past.\nIf we find ourselves ‘abnormally’ affected, if the shouting and the hate and the betrayals and the viciousness cut deep into our minds, we need to take particular care. We may need to fight with extra courage, and assiduously enlist the love of all who care about us, to remain on the side of hope; to ensure that all that is unkind outside of us is never allowed to achieve a victory over the wisdom and goodness that endure within us.",

      "text": "In psychiatric hospitals and consulting rooms worldwide, one of the more unlikely-sounding but very common presenting problems involves aliens. A patient, while perhaps in a state of manic excitement, will describe being in touch with members of an alien civilisation, typically circling the earth in spaceships invisible to standard telescopes and beaming down messages about their species’ imminent arrival – which only the patient is privy to. Everyone else may follow so-called science and bluntly deny that there is anyone out there telling them anything, but the patient – ordinary though they might seem in many ways &#8211; knows otherwise. The aliens are keeping meticulous track of them, they can see them at all times, they can follow their movements (often using a special kind of Wifi) at work and in the supermarket, in their apartment and in the park. And they are sending them a stream of subtle messages about top secret information directly and discreetly into their minds (though the process might require a few technical adjustments, like making sure there’s a blue film or aluminum foil over all the windows). The psychiatrist could be sceptical, many others have been as well, but that’s their loss. It isn’t easy being the sole ambassador to a foreign civilisation about to touch down and change everything.\n\nImage of flying saucer from the USA National Archives and Records Administration\n\nThe point isn’t to debate whether or not any of this is true, it’s to study alien delusions because of what they tell us about the mind, and not just the minds of sufferers themselves, but human minds more broadly. As often with puzzling psychological conditions, we have to start with a very simple-sounding question about motivation: what might be the upside of such a belief? What might be satisfying about thinking in this way? Why might someone abandon standard logic and rationality in favour of ostensibly recondite beliefs?&nbsp;\nAnd here, poignantly, we quickly need to start to think about pain. It will inevitably – for reasons that time is sure to reveal – have become far easier for a patient to believe in aliens than to trust in the model of reality offered by science. The alien delusion has to be read as a persecuted mind’s ingenious, desperate but highly understandable attempt to cope with awfulness. The spaceships and the messages are – in their colourful and creative ways – a bulwark against tragedy.\nA generalisation we can confidently make about almost everyone who ever presents with an alien delusion is that they had a bad childhood, usually a very bad childhood indeed. There will have been a high degree of neglect, humiliation, loneliness and coldness (and very frequently sexual and emotional abuse as well). In such conditions, the emergence of an alien delusion isn’t simple ‘madness,’ it should be interpreted as a pressured mind’s quasi ingenious attempt to find some sort of footing, some kind of explanation, some measure of relief from what would otherwise have been unsustainable cruelty.\nTo believe in aliens is to be offered a range of alleviating and life-sustaining thoughts. Far from being randomly neglected by the world, one is in fact the focus of very close attention from another world altogether. Far from being a mere oddity, lacking friends and feeling one doesn’t fit in because of personal deficiency, one is an outsider because of election, because of an affinity with a foreign and superior set of creatures. Earthlings may not understand one, but a whole other civilisation holds one in exceptionally high regard. The agony of having been (as it were) treated as a weird entity by one’s own parents is transmuted into a belief that one really might be an ‘alien’ in a good sense. As for the constant messages being beamed down, they mean that one is being forever kept in mind; a longing for the sort of sweet whispers that a loving parent might once have given to their baby as they slept in their cot is transmuted into a belief in signs of close love making their way invisibly through the universe.\nIt isn’t – we can see – ever any use telling a believer that they are ‘wrong.’ Far better to lead them, through one’s compassion, very gently, to acknowledge how hard everything has been.&nbsp;\nThe case of alien delusions reminds us that being sane isn’t ever an achievement of logic. It is an outcome of love. It is because we have been treated well by others that we grow up to be people who can afford to stay with reality; the courage and self-belief that love endows us with are what allow us to look without flinching at the very difficult sides of the human condition – without recourse to fantasies and hallucinations. This is not some kind of cleverness or intellectual achievement, it’s a gift of kindness. We should accept too that all of us have our own versions of ‘aliens’ at certain points; delusions that are deployed as a defence against particularly sharp corners of existence. They might be politicians we idealise or communities we hate, relationships we have to destroy or sides of our characters we need to vaunt excessively.&nbsp;\nIf we feel in any way sane today, we shouldn’t take all the credit. Someone somewhere long ago loved us deeply, and wanted us to be here – and that’s why we can, more or less, for now at least, trust in reality, engage with people on our own planet and think straight.",

      "text": "Modern culture can be particularly insistent on this point: mature people shouldn’t mind their own company. Mature people should understand that the precondition of any decent future relationship is deep calm about the prospect of being single for a long time, possibly for ever. Mature people should be profoundly unbothered about dying alone.\nIt sounds so wise that truly wise people should probably silently suspect that something is up. Telling the lonely that they have no right to feel as they do will only ever deepen their sense of isolation. Of course singlehood can be awful. There are scenes of solitude in our apartment and thoughts in our head that we wouldn’t ever want to be recorded and broadcast. But the less we are able to admit to our despair, the more intense it will be, just as part of a solution has to be to know that we have ample right occasionally (or even constantly) to lose our minds about being by ourselves.\n\nPhoto by Ummano Dias on Unsplash\n\nWhat then might be so bad? What exactly are those optimists who laud the joys of having a whole bed to themselves and singing in the bathroom at 3 a.m. missing? Here are some of the low points that deserve lamentation:\n1. The pity of coupled friends; the feeling that those phone calls to us on a Saturday evening are substantially driven by a sense of duty and charity for the sop who has washed up on their own at this advanced age. ‘Poor them,’ the friends will say to themselves as they hang up with a sense of quiet superiority (ultimately driven not by any particular accomplishment on their part besides a greater capacity to put up with the flaws of their substandard partners – a vain defensive idea which isn’t ultimately even that reassuring as we turn on the light of our cold empty bedroom once again).\n2. The realisation, as we look around yet another art gallery, that we don’t give a damn about any of the activities we try so hard to put into our diaries months in advance to prevent a breakdown and in the vain hope that we might meet someone poetic and thoughtful in the cafe; the realisation that we would permanently forego any further acquaintance with Abstract Expressionism, Brazilian Modernism or Melanie Klein’s influence on Psychoanalysis in exchange for someone who could just hold us close and love us.\n3. The moments of exhaustion with all the effort we have to make to maintain discipline and order; a stifled rage that we’re yet again having to cook up a piece of cod and some spinach and changing the sheets of our empty bed when we might as well be eating five cinnamon buns and sleeping on the floor in our day clothes – for all we care about the demented idiot we have to look after who should never have been born.\n4. A sense that we are not in this state by accident, whatever all the nice people tell us: that our isolation in fact reflects something corrupt, ugly, mean-minded and deficient in us that we’ve known about from the start and that doesn’t exist in all those lovely couples who gather in parks in the summer and huddle in cosy restaurants in the winter – and who laugh as we walk past them with that unbudgeable sign over our head that reads ‘Pervert.’\n5. Then there is the awareness that, on top of everything else, we are in this state not just because we’re unlucky but – as our friends artfully hint – because we are also too choosy, too difficult and too stupidly exigent given the qualities we bring to the table. There are people around; like that one with the high-pitched laugh we were introduced to five months ago by our married university friends. Or that one we matched with online who droned on about politics in the professorial voice. But we can’t. On top of everything else, it seems we have standards (that no one else agrees with). We entirely hate our own company, we’re going out of our minds with isolation; and yet still we manage to hate the company of the wrong person even more. \n6. Then, to really dig the knife in, there’s the sweetheart we loved and lost and who enters our minds all the time as we empty the bins and clean the toilet and try to sleep after fantasising about them on the beach holiday we went on. The person who started to drift away from us because we were stupid, too poor and bad in bed – unlike their new partner X, that amazing suitor whose progress we track assiduously on social media when we are not busy writing our love lengthy begging letters (‘I know I was short tempered but…’) that we have at times come to within seconds of sending.\nAll this belongs to the charm of the single state, about which we’re meant to be so proud and so strong. We cannot have a culture that both celebrates love and seeks to create a cult of sagely contented aloneness. Better to admit that in so far as we celebrate love as a summit of achievement, then being alone is also going to feel awful. Not a little bad, but at times very bad indeed. The good news is that, like most ills, it will feel a lot less terrible once we’ve been courageous enough, and kind enough to ourselves, to laugh very darkly for a long time and amply admit that it is so.",

How silly to draw away from intimacy. How ridiculous to spoil trust with suspicions and evasions. Of course the love-shy are unwell, it’s love we’re talking about, not torture or ruin.\nBut what if we began with the evidence. Given how love stories typically go, how normal is it to keep being excited by romance, by the prospect of meeting someone new, of one day taking our clothes off in front of them and of trusting them with one’s most dependent and weakest sides?\n\nCharlotte Salomon, Self-Portrait, 1940\n\nWhat if – after a calm examination of statistics – those who discussed the ‘fear of intimacy’ as if it were an affliction that targeted only the mad turned out to be in their own way the maddest of all? The mystery is not that men and women occasionally go strange at the prospect of love but that they ever dare do anything else, given what can happen, given what usually happens, given what has happened already.\nOf course they seem nice on the early dates, they always do, but the reality is that we won’t know for a year, probably two, possibly ten, who they are deep inside – by which time we won’t have much of our brief lives left, let alone much of our courage or our faith. They may talk sweetly of their cousin or their job; they may make a joke about their ice cream or the people at the next table. But what lies beneath this show of normality, what pathologies are being held carefully at bay – until we’ve given them nicknames, become endeared by their hands and their eyes and grown unable to live without them? When we think of the first evening with x, one would have needed a machine that hasn’t yet been invented to detect the slightest sign of trouble – and that one cost us almost half a decade and a substantial part of our sanity. ‘Please, just tell me right now how you are going to ruin my life,’ we might want to telescope matters to exclaim. \nLet’s admit the truth: we don’t and can’t really trust anyone. Not because we are mean, not because we set out to operate with ingrained misanthropy, but because we are following what life keeps teaching us. We might have the devil opposite us or our saviour; we wouldn’t have a clue one way or the other.&nbsp;\nTherefore, if they invite us back, if they ask if they can see us again, if they message rather quickly, we may end up having to come across as a little bizarre. We may have to conjure up a headache or a crisis at work. It isn’t the height of maturity but then nor is what we have had to endure from their peers in our last three relationships. We want love so much and yet, in some moods, we really don’t want any of it at all. We just want to be in our own bed, curled up, safe, small, maybe with someone else cleverer and wiser than we are off-stage taking care of everything that we’re too young or too old to make sense of.",

It would have made no sense to ask who owned the little vase from Kos or the foldaway umbrella or the guide to Indonesia (where we often went in the imagination and never in reality). It was a life of deceptive permanence, its material stability contingent on a succession of successful emotional moments: conversations in which both people felt heard, a sense of complicity, cuddles.\nNow it’s the gaps that seize the eye. The house has become a museum of absences: that chair where they sat on the first evening (how shy we both were), the corner of the garden where we made the most of the hesitant summer sun and they wore the hat we bought them back from Portugal, the nails in the wall where their Agnes Martin print used to hang. Every time we think we may be over the worst, we’re caught out by a new object that starts to scream at us with panicked insistence (who knew a cushion could sound so desperate): ‘But they’re gone! And it will never, ever be OK again…’\n\nJacques-Émile Blanche, Still Life with Knife, 1889\n\nSome days there’s an impulse to flee this emotional graveyard. At work, we can almost feel as if we’ve survived, at least for a few hours. But here, in what should be a sanctuary, especially at night, the pained history clings to every surface. The only way out is going to be eventually to lay down new memories, so that the sofa can be about something other than their cosiness and the bathroom won’t still be speaking (and torturing us with mentions) of their conversations. One day, someone else’s head will be resting against the pillows and another’s phone will be recharging by the night table – though (for no warranted reason) the thought presently brings on untenable guilt and nausea. \nWhat unexpected rates of interest happiness charges. If only the sweet times had come with warning labels. We knew well enough that the arguments and lengthy discussions towards the end were awful. What we hadn’t quite understood until now is that these would be the easy bits; that as soon as they left, it would be the lovely days that would really start to torment us. Good or bad, simply everything seems to hurt.&nbsp;\nThere’s going to be no way out. It really will just take a certain amount of time. We probably have five hundred hours of mourning ahead of us until all those rugs, cupboards, cutlery drawers, bookshelves and pieces of furniture start to take pity on us – and might one day leave us free to think of something else.",

      "text": "It’s one of the puzzles of relationships that, after a hugely promising few months or years, one of the members of a couple may start to exhibit notably aggressive and unyielding behaviour. Out go their previous tenderness and loveliness and in come roughness and neglect. All they seem to want to do is to go out alone with their friends and flirt with strangers.&nbsp;\nOne might wonder if it’s the other person in the couple who might somehow be to blame for this. Perhaps they’ve done something wrong and they are being – in certain ways appropriately – punished for not living up to expectations that they set.\nBut the truth may be a great deal more circuitous and complex. In certain cases, the partner is in fact being punished, but not for doing anything wrong. If we can put it this way, they are being punished precisely for doing things rather right. They are being punished for not abandoning their lover, for not being cross, for not being mean, for not looking elsewhere, for not shouting, for not bullying and for not humiliating. They are being punished for their sweetness, crushed for their gentleness and tormented for their faith.\n\nRogier van der Weyden, Detail from The Descent from the Cross, 1435\n\nWhy on earth might kindly behaviours prove problematic? Because – in one of the truly oddest-sounding phenomena of love – the kindness of the partner may trigger an intense wish in a person to punish their lover for what – many years before in their childhood – a parent did wrong to them. It’s the very sweetness of the partner, their kindness and loyalty, their disinclination to violence and unreason, that create the perfect conditions in which a hurt party will experience and then redirect a resentment and a rage that were actually owed, but could never be delivered to, a disappointing parent. The appalling behaviour winds up as a hugely peculiar and deeply tragic tribute to a unique degree of generosity and care.\nThe arena in which this pattern can most clearly be observed is not directly in relationships, but in adoptive families. Research repeatedly shows that the nicer a recipient family is, the more an adopted child is liable – in adolescence – to become very difficult indeed. They will steal from their adopted family, perhaps scrawl on the walls, scream at them during arguments, tell them they loathe them and then leave the house for hours slamming the door behind them. \n‘What in heavens name have we done to deserve this?’ the adoptive parents may ask themselves in despair. And the answer, entirely odd though it might sound, is: ‘Absolutely nothing, which is exactly why you are being hurt so badly. You’re being treated horribly for not being horrible. You’re being made to feel what the abandoned infant once had to go through when no one else cared to listen. You’re having to hear cries that went unheard. You have created the very conditions of safety in which intense pain can finally find a way out.’\nA version of the same dynamic can unfold – more surreptitiously – in adult love. Behind every drama a person in a couple may cause, every holiday they ruin, every month they chew up, is a muffled, incoherent but essential complaint: ‘Where were you when I really, really needed you? How dare you be so kind to me when all I’ve had is cruelty all my life? How can I possibly deal with this loveliness when pain has been my home all along? Fuck off and die for trying to save and adore me.’\nThere is no alternative here but insight, enormous (boundaried) compassion – and an awareness that the person who is acting up still wants love very badly, they just have no clue how to accept it. One day, after much thought and therapy, perhaps long after the relationship has ended, the destructive party needs to find a way to express the truth to the first person who ever loved them: ‘Thank you for being kind enough to elicit my rage and my sadism. Apologies, deep apologies, for trying to destroy you for your unremitting love. I never wanted to harm you. I just had no idea what to do with the pain inside me.’ In the skies up above, angels will be weeping.",

If love is sincere, of course it won’t stop at any obstacles, however large. You either love a person and will fight till the end to be with them or don’t love them and will walk away. There isn’t, and can’t be, any third category that isn’t a deceit.\nUnderneath this uncompromising stance lies an ideology of Romanticism that insists that true love has nothing to do with practicalities. The novelist D. H. Lawrence captured this absolutist view when he wrote: &#8216;A man in love will sleep for the rest of his life on a park bench for a woman he loves.&#8217; And so by extension, if there are children from another relationship, if there is no money, if one of the parties lives abroad, if someone has a mental illness, if there are cultural differences, if long term goals point in contrasting directions, there will always be a way through.&nbsp;\n\nFerdinand Heilbuth, A Man Sitting on a Bench, c. 1870s\n\nBut there is another philosophy at large, more restrained and less esteemed, that balances a respect for emotions with an equal respect for the practical dimensions of life. This philosophy knows that however tender and sympathetic our feelings may be, they cannot entirely mitigate or erase the impact of social ostracism, opposed friendship groups, clashing values, ongoing distance, incongruous life stages, continuous alarm – or park benches. \nIf we understand love as ultimately focused on the care and nurture of another person, should we continue to label as loving a relationship that necessarily mires our partner in a succession of avoidable miseries? Are we so uniquely fitted to be with them as to justify the suffering our presence entails? Might our so-called love for them not in the end have more to do with our satisfaction than their fulfilment?\nThere are of course liars who will dress up their escapes as acts of generosity, but there are as many true lovers who quietly sacrifice themselves on unheralded altars. It is hugely honourable – and very moving – to do one’s utmost to be with someone. It may be greater love still to adore a person – and then, before wasting any more of their time, to leave them well alone.",

      "text": "Stoicism was a philosophy invented by leading minds in Ancient Greece and Rome to help us cope with agonising periods of our lives, especially those created by the selfishness and insanity of dictators and demagogues.\n\nEugène Delacroix, Last Words of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, c. 1844\n\nHere are some of their most significant sayings, which retain a power to console us and lend perspective to this day.\n“Be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.”\nMarcus Aurelius\nFor the Stoics, life is a tempest whose onslaughts are relentless and pitiless, and over which we have little control. We can no more change our outer fate than alter the weather. However, what we can change is our attitude to this fate and here the Stoics recommended that we adopt an imperturbable posture, based on an awareness that we can ultimately deal with the very worst that life could throw at us. Outside, there may be a maelstrom, but so long as we have properly strengthened our character through philosophical exercise, we can endure.\n“Rehearse them in your mind: exile, torture, war, shipwreck&#8230; All human possibilities should be before our eyes.”\nSeneca\nThe Stoics believed that regularly reflecting on the bad things that might befall us is a way of strengthening ourselves against anxiety, for what we examine rationally close up tends to be less frightening than what we merely apprehend vaguely from a distance. They liked to perform what they called a praemeditatio malorum (‘premeditation on evil’), a process wherein one imagines all the potential disasters that might befall us, not to depress us, but to help us prepare for setbacks in good time. We shouldn’t hope for the best, but arm ourselves for the worst, steeling ourselves to cope with dark possibilities. The Stoic assumption is that we are far better able to endure bad things than we think, so long as we are ready for them.&nbsp;\n“He who is feared will also end up fearful. No one can arouse terror and also have peace of mind.”\nSeneca\nSeneca had been the tutor to the future Emperor Nero, a byword for cruelty and untrammelled viciousness. So he well understood the follies of the powerful and liked to remind them that true security can never be won by terrifying or humiliating others. That is the way to make enemies and also, to arouse one’s own guilty conscience.&nbsp; Seneca insists that to treat others with compassion and respect is therefore not just morally right, it serves our self-interest as well. Tyrants will be forever troubled by the thought that those they punish or frighten will exact some form of vengeance; it is only the benevolent and patient who will be able to sleep easily at night.\n“True good fortune is not to need good fortune.”\nSeneca\nThe Stoics set themselves resolutely against what the Romans called ‘Fortune’. Most Romans worshipped the Goddess of Fortune, asking her for gifts and favours (a long life, a happy marriage). But the Stoics rebelled against the fickleness of Fortune and wished their followers to achieve contentment of mind without depending on her whims and unjust distributions of ‘luck’. They urged us to construct our happiness on things invulnerable to the ebbs and flows of fortune: for example, on the contemplation of philosophy, on an indifference to reputation and jobs, and on serene friendships with other Stoic minds.&nbsp;\n“Nowhere you can go should be more peaceful— and more free of interruptions—than your own soul.”\nMarcus Aurelius\nThe Stoics accepted that they could not control the whole world. In this sense, they despaired of traditional politics or warfare. They believed that true serenity could only be discovered through working on one’s own mind – a far more realistic aim than rendering government rational or making a fortune. Calm was the fruit of a process of introspection that closely resembled what we would now call psychotherapy: in the presence of an intelligent friend or on our own, we should sift through the contents of our minds and correct and disable the worst of our panic. We should understand how often fears have nothing to do with facts.\n“Nothing happens to anyone that he can&#8217;t endure.”\nMarcus Aurelius\nIt is often said that the purpose of Stoicism is to help us become more resilient. Yet it would be more accurate to say that it helps us to recognise the reserves of resilience we already possess. Though we often feel weak and fragile in anticipation of problems, and fear being unable to cope, the truth is that each of us is fitted, by what the Stoics called nature, with extraordinary ways of enduring difficulties. We could cope with having only one leg, with being exiled, with losing our employment – and even ultimately with having to die (people do it every day&#8230;). We should take courage from our innate ability to persevere, no matter how great our trials.\n“&#8217;My brother ought not to have treated me so.&#8217; True: but he must see to that. However he may treat me, I must deal rightly by him. This is what lies with me, what no one else can hinder.”\nEpictetus\nAgain and again, Stoicism advises us to worry about what we can control and forgive or let go of phenomena outside our reach. Stoicism’s core insight is that, ultimately, each of us has power only over ourselves. So there is no use in complaining about the behaviour of others, since we generally can’t alter this one iota. All we can affect is our own behaviour. Each of us has the duty to lead a virtuous life, regardless of the actions or reactions of others around us. What they do shouldn’t concern us: it is what we do that matters.\n“If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes.”\n Seneca\nA Stoic sees existence as an endless cycle of crises – illness, conflict, financial hardship, mental breakdown, bereavement, and eventually death. There is nothing malign about this – indeed, it is the will of the logos, the organising principle of the universe. It is simply the way things are. Therefore, we should live our lives in preparation for a coming crisis: training ourselves to be calm and unflinching in the face of inevitable trials. Philosophy is the name we give to practicing and thinking through the worst – before the tempest actually hits.\n“Never be keen to please the crowd.”\nQuintus Sextius\nThere is a strain of solipsism within Stoicism – an insistence on the self as the focal point of a virtuous, meaningful life. A fundamental error that most people make, in this view, is to live according to the whims of others: whims we can neither adequately comprehend or control, and which will tend to abnegate our true desires, purpose and potential. Our life should be lived on our own terms – according to our own principles and beliefs – not anyone else’s. Living in a very crowded and chaotic Roman world, the Stoics argued for a refreshing degree of inner independence and indifference to the voices of public opinion.\n“Do you know what makes people greedy for the future? It is when they haven’t yet found themselves.”\nSeneca\nThe Stoics did not place huge emphasis on trying to living a long time; they held that a life in which we have understood what really counts can be meaningful even if it is relatively short. We shouldn’t measure a life by the hours it contains; rather by the wisdom, love and intelligence with which these hours have been spent. We are not, in the end, ever really very short of time. What we’re truly short of is affection, open-heartedness, kindness and tolerance. We’re short of the ability to create peak experiences in which we are sufficiently unfrightened, approachable, and responsive. We may have a lot to mourn, but it isn’t necessarily the imminence of death, it may more be the difficulty of living with courage and sensitivity. The challenge of our lives is to learn to live deeply rather than broadly.\n“Very little is needed to make a happy life.”\nMarcus Aurelius\nSuch a sentiment might seem ironic and untrue, coming as it did from a philosopher who was (remarkably) simultaneously the Emperor of Rome, yet Marcus Aurelius’s example is all the more edifying because it would have been so easy for him to live in the decadent ways of his predecessors. Instead, he sincerely devoted himself to the tenets of Stoicism: he had no interest in worldly wealth, he worked on quelling his anxieties, he paid little attention to vanity and idle gossip, he regularly meditated on the contents of his own mind (even during military campaigns) – and he slept in bare and unpretentious quarters. It is hard enough to be wise as an ordinary person; power and money give madness yet more opportunities. The Stoics are especially impressive because so many of their leading adherents were powerful, but remained wise and modest inside.\n\n“The short cut to wealth is through the contempt of wealth.”\nSeneca\nThe Stoics proposed that wealth is always relative to desire: whenever we have what we want, we can be counted as rich, and whenever we feel lacking, we must qualify as poor – whatever the actual sum of money we happen to have. There are therefore two ways to make someone ‘rich’: we can increase their income or decrease their extent of their desires. The Stoics argued for the latter approach, training themselves to see how many material longings are – when we examine them closely – vain and disconnected from true fulfilment.  The Stoics went on to propose that a boundless appetite for money is frequently a symptom of an anxious mind, striving to achieve through wealth a sense of security that can in fact only be gained through self-examination and friendship.\n“The wise do not put a wrong construction upon everything.’\nSeneca\nOne of the most fundamental paths to calm is the power to hold on, even in very challenging situations, to a distinction between what someone does – and what they meant to do. But unfortunately, we’re seldom very good at perceiving what motives happen really to be involved in the incidents that hurt us. We are easily and wildly mistaken. We are often a little paranoid. We see intention where there was none and escalate and confront when no strenuous or agitated responses are warranted. In a bid to calm us, the Stoics emphasised the extent to which most people who frustrate us do so unintentionally. It’s bad enough that we should be annoyed, we should not assume that people are – on top of it all – irritating us on purpose.\n&#8220;What progress, you ask, have I made? I have begun to be a friend to myself. That is indeed a great benefit. You may say that such a man is a friend to all mankind.’ \nSeneca\nThe less we like ourselves, the more we appear in our own eyes as really rather plausible targets for mockery and harm. Why would a drill have started up outside, just as we were settling down to work? Why would the call center operator be taking so long to find our details? Because there is – logically enough – a plot against us. When we carry an excess of self-disgust around with us, operating just below the radar of conscious awareness, we’ll constantly seek confirmation that we really are the worthless people we take ourselves to be. That’s why the Stoics emphasised the need to like ourselves more in order to interpret the world with greater benevolence.\n&#8220;When he was dying,  Alexander of Macedon’s end differed not a jot from his stable-boy’s. Either both were received into the same generative principle of the universe, or both alike were dispersed into atoms.&#8220;\nMarcus Aurelius\nThe Roman world which the Stoics navigated was deeply stratified and unequal; yet for the Stoics (as for the Christians who followed them) there is much more that connects than separates us. We all suffer, are all exposed to accident and must all die. It is on the recognition of these sort of shared vulnerabilities that friendship can be based – and flourish even between social classes. There is a relaxing dimension to the idea of our fundamental equality. Marcus Aurelius, though Emperor, liked to remind himself that his life was – from a suitable distance – utterly ordinary and unremarkable. Ironically, we remember and respect him today not for having been a mighty ruler but from having revealed his humanity in his writings.\n&#8220;How important it is to say to oneself &#8216;This purple vestment is some sheep’s hair moistened in the blood of some shellfish.&#8216;&#8221;\nMarcus Aurelius\nIn Ancient Rome, only high up military generals and Emperors were allowed to wear the supreme symbol of power and significance: a purple toga. Marcus Aurelius was keen never to let such power go to his head and so liked to remind himself of the vanity of all earthly things. It calmed him down before important speeches in the senate or imperial occasions in his palace to think of how absurd we humans are, when viewed obliquely through a non-human lens. We might follow him in calming down in front of scary and ‘impressive’ people by imagining them sitting on the toilet. And if we are ever in danger of taking sex too seriously, Marcus Aurelius is on hand to remind us: ‘When it comes to sexual intercourse, we must say, “This is the rubbing together of membranes, accompanied by the spasmodic ejaculation of a sticky liquid.’\n&#8220;When Zeno received news of a shipwreck and heard that all his luggage had been sunk, he said, ‘Fortune bids me to be a less encumbered philosopher.’&#8220;\nSeneca\nTo be ‘Stoic’ still to this day indicates a capacity to take disasters calmly. Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, was famously level-headed in the face of reversals – and the anecdote of how well he behaved when he lost his luggage was well-known to all students of Stoicism. The wise will learn to identify what is necessary and too-late-to-change and resign themselves to reality at speed, rather than kicking it against it in fury. They aren’t the ones to shout at airports when they hear of a delay or worse. We may be powerless to alter certain events,  but we remain free to choose our attitude towards them, and it is in our spontaneous acceptance of necessity that we find our distinctive Stoic freedom.\n&#8220;Winter brings on cold weather; and we must shiver. Summer returns, with its heat and we must sweat. Unseasonable weather upsets the health, and we must fall ill… We cannot change this order of things&#8230;it is to this law of nature that our souls must adjust themselves, this they should follow, this they should obey… That which you cannot reform, it is best to endure.&#8220;\nSeneca\nThe Stoics spoke a lot about the ‘laws of nature’, to which they felt we had to submit far more often and far more graciously than we tend to. By ‘nature’, the Stoics understood everything that exceeds us. In natural phenomena lie reminders of all that we are powerless to change: the weather, but also oceans, glaciers, cliffs, stars – these deeply impressed the Stoics as examples of things that transcend our strengths. In the human world, we may grow to believe that we can always alter our destinies, and hope and worry accordingly. However, it is apparent from the heedless pounding of the oceans or the flight of comets across the night sky that there are forces entirely indifferent to and far more significant than us. The Stoics loved Nature for giving us elegant lessons in humility.\n\nManuel Domínguez Sánchez, Death of Seneca, c. 1871\n\n“What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.”\nSeneca\nThe Stoics often combined a highly serious tone with a note of dark humour, as in this quietly hilarious aphorism by Seneca. The greatest solace for moments of suffering, say the Stoics, is to adopt a broader perspective on one’s disappointments. It is in the end not specific hardships that we should regret, but the whole business of being alive: that we are members of a fragile species condemned to lead tragic lives curtailed by fate and pain. This is the essence of melancholy wisdom: a recognition that suffering is not particular, but universal, and that our own tears fall into oceans of pre-existing woe.\n“We never anticipate evils before they actually arrive, but, imagining that we ourselves are exempt and are travelling a less exposed path, we refuse to be taught by the mishaps of others that such are the lot of all. So many funerals pass our doors, yet we never dwell on death. So many deaths are untimely, yet we make plans for our own infants: how they will don the toga, serve in the army, and succeed to their father&#8217;s property.&#8221; \nSeneca\nA dangerous naivety is embedded in our views of normality. We are prone to believe, for example, that it is normal that our children will not expire suddenly before their twenty-fifth birthdays, that we will live to see our grandchildren, that an earthquake won&#8217;t promptly shatter our belongings, that we won&#8217;t be disgraced, that our best friend won&#8217;t be killed by a tile blown off a roof in high wind… But this is normality only when we sentimentally restrict the evidence. With the aperture fully open on reality, we are faced with a far broader range of normal things. We should cease to formulate our sense of reality merely on the basis of probability. Any accident to which a human has been subject, however rare, however distant in time, should be incorporated into our dark vision. As Seneca adds: “You say: &#8216;I did not think it would happen.&#8217; But do you think there is anything that will not happen, when you know that it is possible to happen?&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n&#8220;All of us are inconsiderate and thoughtless, all of us are unreliable, querulous, ambitious&#8230; All of us are bad. Whatever he blames in another, each will find in his own heart&#8230; So we should be more indulgent towards one another. We are bad men living among bad men; and only one thing can calm us – we must agree to go easy on one another.&#8221;\nSeneca\nConfronted with the bad behaviour of others, we can feel unhelpfully righteous. To break this mindset, Seneca urged us to extend empathy to more than just those who commit exactly our errors. We might indeed be incapable of certain blunders, but we should stretch examples to other frailties. The punctual might learn to forgive the unpunctual by thinking of, for instance, the cowardice they exhibited at the close of a relationship. To appease our intolerance of the shortcomings of others, we should modestly accept that we are never ourselves far from committing faults of comparable or greater gravity. As Seneca concludes: ‘We have all sinned.’\n“The wise man will live as long as he ought, not as long as he can… He always reflects concerning the quality, and not the quantity, of his life. As soon as there are numerous events in his life that give him trouble and disturb his peace of mind, he sets himself free. And this privilege is his, not only when the crisis is upon him, but as soon as Fortune seems to be maltreating him; then he looks about carefully and sees whether he ought, or ought not, to end his life on that account… It is not a question of dying earlier or later, but of dying well or ill. And dying well means escape from the danger of living ill.”\nSeneca\nSurprisingly, the Stoics did not condemn suicide out of hand. Seneca was not advocating random or thoughtless exits; he was attempting to give us more courage in the face of anxiety by reminding us that it is always within our remit, when we have genuinely tried everything and rationally had enough, to choose a path out of our troubles. He was seeking to strip willed death of its associations with pathology and to render it instead an option that the wise always know is there as a backstop. It doesn’t even need to be a grim spectre; the Stoics emphasised that death could be a moment to celebrate what had gone well in a life, to thank friends and to appreciate the beautiful and good sides of the world. The idea was to see death as a door through which we knew we had the right and the capacity to walk through when it felt necessary.\n“We cannot complain of life; it keeps no one against his will. Humanity is well situated, because no man is unhappy except by his own fault. Live, if you so desire; if not, you may return to the place whence you came… If you would pierce your heart, a gaping wound is not necessary – a lancet will open the way to that great freedom, and tranquillity can be purchased at the cost of a pin-prick.”\nSeneca\nThe whole point of Stoic philosophy is to help us reach a point where we are not held hostage by the infinite cruelties of Fortune. The wise person tries to get to a stage where the indignities that Fortune may impose don’t constantly terrify and crush them and where they have a feeling of being able to dodge Fortune’s blows when they need to. This explains the primordial position of death within the Stoic thesis – and why the wise can fairly meditate on their capacity to leave their own lives at a moment of their choosing. The Stoics were among the most intelligent, kindly, wise and gentle people who have ever lived. However alien some of their views may sound, we would do well to extend sympathy to why they held them – and what relief they would have found in them on their most challenging days.",

      "text": "We can be cursed by a particularly pernicious and shame-bounded fear which stops us from flourishing at work, going out socially or simply enjoying being alive: the fear that we will suddenly be seized by an overwhelming impulse to defecate or vomit.\nIf we take this to a doctor, they will ask us questions and run us through a battery of tests but they may end up concluding that there is nothing ‘wrong’ with us. Which only serves to show how narrow a concept of illness medicine sometimes works with. There is definitely something up with us; it’s just that the issue lies in our minds rather than in our bowels or stomachs.\n\nAnonymous, Young Woman on her Deathbed, c. 1621\n\nThe issue appears to revolve around a conundrum about acceptability. In the eyes of strangers, there can be few more disagreeable or unsettling things about us than our shit or vomit. These are substances that speak, however unfairly, of ignominy and shame, abasement and humiliation. They may be used to form a conclusive argument against our dignity.&nbsp;\nNormally, if we have been handled with love and learnt to treat ourselves kindly as a result, we can take a serene, benevolent view of these entirely natural effluvia. They may present certain challenges, but their appearance need never be a matter of particular repugnance or odium; only occasions for sympathy and care.\nBut we may not have learnt very much tenderness towards ourselves in this area – and by implication in many others too. We may have grown up with a background sense that much was displeasing and besmirched about us. Our presence didn’t delight those who put us on the earth or were entrusted with our care. Perhaps we didn’t look as nice as they had hoped, or we weren’t as clever or our arrival distracted them from their personal ambitions. They may have scolded us or rarely offered reassurance or sweetness. And as a result of ongoing neglect, we are liable to have developed intense feelings of redundancy and degradation. \nIt’s a principle of psychology that dilemmas that haven’t been resolved in the past will constantly seek expression in the present, in the vain hope that some kind of better ending for them can be found. We repeat unpleasant feelings not just to torture ourselves but – more hopefully – to build a way out of our agonies. Therefore, one way to read the repeated feelings of nausea (emetophobia and coprophobia) is that they are articulations of unresolved torments around our right to be. We may, in adulthood, have become hugely accomplished, popular and charming (precisely from a fear of being none of these things). We may have secured an impressive job and earnt the friendship of many. But this only serves to highlight a dilemma in our assessment of ourselves: deep down, whatever others may say, we feel awful. We may look respectable, but in our core, we still take ourselves to be abhorrent, superfluous people. We are still – somewhere within – just a piece of shit who sickens everyone. \nIt can be instructive to study when the desire to vomit or defecate reaches a pitch. It tends to be not when we are alone or getting on quietly with a task we’re confident about; the panic grips us when there start to be expectations of us, when people begin to think we are very skilled, or impressive, clever or nice. It can become overwhelming on a date, before a speech or at a gathering of new friends.&nbsp;\nThe contrast between what we feel inside and who others take us to be then seeks a benighted and excruciating form of expression. Our fear contains a strangled honest cry: ‘I’m terrified that I can’t be the nice person you take me to be. There is so much that you couldn’t bear about me if you knew…’ It isn’t that we don’t want to please, just that we can’t believe that we have any right to do so. The shit and the vomit will finally prove to onlookers that we are the fundamentally awful people we suspect we are; they will align the outer verdict with the inner one.&nbsp;\nBut destroying our image publicly isn’t really what we want to do. The true longing is more complicated and more hopeful: that we will be allowed to be less than impressive and still be deemed OK.\nThe fear teaches us about love. Though we may all want to be admired for our accomplishments, the true longing is that we be sympathised with for our weaknesses. Anyone can admire us for our power; the truly kind person feels tenderness for us in our befoulments. We might have as children have soiled ourselves in the playground but a loving parent would not have panicked. They would have taken us home, said calmly: ‘don’t worry, we’ll sort this out in a minute’ and given us a hug once we were in fresh clothes again.&nbsp;\nBut if things never happened so gently, the shit and the vomit represent confused attempts to get back to the primal wound. Once we learn more about our inchoate psychological cravings, and the deprivations we went through, we may come to compensate for our losses through understanding and self-compassion, and our physical vulnerabilities may abate. We may with time be able to accept that we are worthy even in our illness and our weakness. We may learn, as we should always have known, that we amply deserve to exist.",

      "text": "It is evident that life on this planet is far more awful than it needs to be because of something very peculiar and sad inside we humans: a constant inclination to unleash conflict, beat up our neighbours, seize their lands and lay waste to their cities. How prosperous we could now all be if we didn’t have to restart civilisation every few decades after yet another eruption of horror.\nThe question is why we’re like this. When the people we call historians talk about conflicts, the blame is almost always laid at the door of material factors. Dictators come to the fore and territories are taken because human beings are apparently very hungry for money and assets. Greed is the motor of history.\nBut the truth may be rather different – and far stranger. If we properly explore historical upheavals, the violence and chaos almost never have much to do with anything material, and a great amount to do with psychology, and in particular, to put it very bluntly, with love. People overwhelmingly go to war not for the sake of material accumulation but in order to secure honour, to recover a sense of dignity, to insist on respect, to feel applauded, to be looked up to and to correct an otherwise uncontainable feeling of invisibility, neglect and humiliation – a narcissistic wound shared as much by leaders as by a decisive share of their adherents. There may of course be the odd occasion when there is a particularly pressing practical reason to seize a river or a valley, but almost all the time, the real drive to put on one’s boots and pulverise another country lies elsewhere: in a psychologically-based craving for applause and from a wish to compensate through military means for a devastating absence of an inner sense of love.\nThink of Benito Mussolini. A few months before the outbreak of the Second World War, the dictator of Italy ordered his troops to invade neighbouring Albania. Albania’s small army was quickly defeated and within a week the country was formally united with Italy. It was a minor but hugely revealing episode in the long history of human aggression. On the surface Mussolini was acting for material and strategic reasons: he wanted access to mineral resources; there was a particularly good harbour where Italian warships could be based; Albania provided a base from which further incursions into the Balkans could be launched. This is the sort of instinctive analysis that historians always go in for: countries act, even if lamentably, out of practical self-interest.\nBut this fails to capture the real dynamics at play. Mussolini had risen to power in the 1920s because he brilliantly articulated a conviction that many of his compatriots shared: that they were not properly respected or appreciated in the world. He saw his country – and himself – as slighted and snubbed. And he responded by stressing lost grandeur; he deployed the language, gestures and imagery of domination and authority to ward off a painful inner sense of total weakness. His appeal to his supporters was: ‘you feel rejected, lonely and misunderstood, I feel the same, I love you and together we will fight to be noticed’. Like so many others before and after him, this is ultimately what Mussolini was always shouting to his crowds about from flag-draped balconies.\n\n   A sense of humiliation is met by grandiose self-assertion.\n\nDeep down, the modern analysis of politics and history rests on a flawed economically-founded assumption: that the most terrible thing in life is not to have as many possessions as another person. But the truth is different: the most terrible thing in a life is actually to be ignored and not respected, especially when one’s parents weren’t kind to one in childhood; a fate worse than death and (in fragile minds) therefore worth causing untold deaths for and dying for. \nThat’s why Mussolini invaded Albania – and that’s why almost every other conflict has begun: with a sense in a people that they didn’t feel very good inside, and so would have to destroy others’ cities in a bid to assuage their gnawing inner sense of humiliation. \nIf this all sounds a little ridiculous and petty, that’s is a very a good thing indeed. We do ourselves a central disservice when we discuss wars and politics in so-called reasonable terms. The brutality isn’t ever about strategy or spheres of influence, oil or water. We need to frame matters in far more bathetic and urgent terms: it’s about mental illness.&nbsp;\nThere is plenty of land and wealth to go around. What there evidently isn’t enough of is sanity and beneath that, psychological security. We will keep fighting and having to destroy and rebuild civilisation until we properly understand what motivates humans; and grasp that there is literally nothing more dangerous in this world than a certain kind of person who wasn’t cherished in their early years, who feels underloved and invisible and who won’t rest – or leave you in peace or even alive – until you’ve noticed them.",

      "text": "It’s one of the peculiarities of the way we’re built that we lack immediate access to many of our most important emotions. When people ask us ‘how are you?’ and we reply in vague and superficial terms, we aren’t often simply hiding our real feelings from our audiences, we may not be in touch with them ourselves.&nbsp;\nIt’s possible to spend a good deal of our lives with our attention trained firmly outwards. We might be chairing back to back meetings, drawing up budgets or travelling from one location to another – and all the while have little active sense that we are – in fact, in the background – exhausted, enraged, jealous, heartbroken or nostalgic. The people and situations that made us so could have disappeared long before we develop any active sense of what they provoked in us. We might be the stated owners of our whole beings; yet we consciously inhabit only a very small part of ourselves.\n\nClaude Monet, Woman in a Garden, c. 1867\n\nOur incapacity to know our minds directly can be traced back to our early years. We tend to realise how we’re feeling only to the extent that other people once took an interest in how we were feeling, especially in emotions that may not have appeared entirely ‘normal’ or ‘good’. Perhaps, as children, we expressed occasional wishes that granny would die, that the school would burn down or that we could get rid of our younger sibling. It’s the mark of a sound parent to be able to bear to listen to such complexities without censorship – which in turn allows the child to be less frightened of, and readier to explore, the less well-lit corners of their own minds. The central legacy of having been heard by others is a greater capacity to hear oneself.\nTo start to regain a better hold on our true feelings, we should submit ourselves to an artificial exercise: we should ask ourselves a series of structured questions. We should, when we have time off, probably late at night or in the early morning, lie somewhere quietly without interruption, perhaps close our eyes and interview our minds as if they belonged to someone else (they sort of do).&nbsp;\nWe should direct the following questions at ourselves, not thinking too much as we answer, simply saying what comes immediately to mind (our real selves tend to hide or lie if given too much time to respond).\n1. I feel…\nThe answer might be sadder, more hopeful or more repetitive than we had imagined or wanted to imagine.\n2. I really need…\nWe are so busy with the requirements of others, we typically forget to observe our own stifled needs. They may not fit the standard view of who we should be or what it is respectable to want, which makes their honest acceptance all the more important. It made not be perfect that we want to go back to our ex or tell our mother we despise her or curl up in a small ball and cry. But it’s extremely helpful to know that these are our wants, which prevents our minds shutting down into depression or anxiety – or our bodies having to nudge us to insight through a twitch or a cold or another bout of back pain.\n3. I’m angry that…\nFrom the earliest age, we were probably told not to be too angry, but that doesn’t stop us from being so, indeed, it’s the very underlying suggestion that anger is bad that leads to a build up of true volcanic fury.\n4. I’m hurt that…\nWe are more delicate than we imagine. No hour goes by without some wound to our sense of integrity. We learnt to be tough but the armour only covers our external self. Inside, we’re as often in tears as a four year old.\n5. My body wants…\nIt’s odd to think that our bodies might want anything at all. But they have as much to say to us as our minds. And if we keep not listening to them, they’ll have to start to insist on sending us their messages in the only way they know how: via illnesses.\nAfter twenty minutes of self-interview, we’re likely to have a slightly different sense of who we are to what we’d imagined. We’re stranger no doubt, but we’re also far more interesting and vivid. We exchange a plastified identity for the truth. The more we can be aware of what we truly experience, the lighter and more unburdened we can feel.",

We are awaiting an email… but it’s still not arrived. They said they would call at five…the phone remains still.\nIt’s a feature of our minds that we cannot help but fill silences; we automatically develop notions of what an absence must signify. And, according to the particular architecture of our psyches, these significations will show radical variations.&nbsp;\n\nRobert Motherwell, Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110, c. 1971\n\nFor some of us, it seems evident that a silence means something like:\n— They have been delayed, they will get back soon enough.\n— They are busy.\n— It slipped their mind.\n— They love us anyway.\nBut for others, it seems equally likely that the silence is a far darker omen:\n— They’ve realised I’m awful.\n— They have suddenly turned against me.\n— I’ve done something wrong.\n— They hate me.\nWe are catching in a minor area a central element of our emotional functioning, with deep roots into our life stories. What we imagine lies behind the other’s silence reflects in key ways what did happen to us around our caregivers in our early years. We are filling in the gaps with evidence unconsciously drawn from our own experience. We are presuming that the future will in key ways resemble the past.\nIf we take the silence to be benign, it’s because people close to us would have been – more or less – reliable and kind. There were, as we grew up, no sudden abandonments or changes of mind. We weren’t tolerated one minute, disdained the next. We felt safe. But if the silence is immediately taken to be a cause for alarm and a harbinger of persecution and loathing, it’s because we come from a place of pain. We will have felt, almost certainly before our eighth year, continually at risk of being thought to have done something wrong, we would have been mocked, someone would have turned against us. The sense of danger would have been constant.\nWe generally have no awareness that we are – as we look at our phones and wonder – relying on past experience. We no more remember how we learnt to feel this way than we remember how we learnt to ride a bicycle or speak. Our characteristic way of interpreting reality doesn’t reveal its personally-flavoured origins – and is therefore less open to question and recalibration.\nIf we suffer repeatedly from panic about silences, the next step is to notice what we are up to and accept that our minds were not born responding in this partial way, they were scarred and disrupted by specific events from which we have drawn unfairly harsh generalisations: that we are constantly bad, that we will always be in trouble, that we are permanently insufficient. We should with kindness interrupt our instinctual responses and insist on less punitive readings. The catastrophe we fear will happen has – many&nbsp; years ago – already happened and we need to start to remember it, and feel compassion towards ourselves for having endured it, in the quest for a less frightened, fairer and more innocent future.",

The problem is how much of it is extremely sensible and therefore, in its way, utterly ineffective, for what we are dealing with in heartbreak is not some administrative malfunction for which one or two handy pointers will swiftly return a sufferer to the norm, but a wholesale and long-term loss of command over one’s emotional constitution – for which the most apposite response may be limitless acknowledgement of the scale of the crisis, unbounded compassion and a heavy emphasis on the utter reasonableness of madness.\n\nChaïm Soutine, Woman in Pink, c. 1924\n\nHere therefore are a few slightly less conventional pieces of advice for those who, ten months or fifteen years after a break-up, are still finding few more compelling things to think about today than their lost love.\nDon’t expect to get over this any time soon\nSevere damage is done by those who, out of great kindness, frame heart-break as something that we must all inevitably get over with time.&nbsp;\nBut what if there were no ‘shoulds’ in this area. What if we let the pain last just as long – and not a minute less – as it needs to, which might be three months, ten years or the rest of one’s life but in any case, considerably longer than one’s sensible married friends seem to think it should last. What if we recategorised this as a chronic illness rather than a passing cold. What if we didn’t compound our sorrows by setting bounds to them and then castigating ourselves for trespassing them. What if we assumed – very darkly – that we would just never get over this.\nBuild the loss into your identity\nWhat if, at the same time, we were to put the loss at the front and center of everything. Not relegate it to some embarrassing corner of our biographies, but build it squarely into our sense of self and presentation to others. We might say henceforth that we aren’t just someone born in this or that country in this or that year with a certain job and set of hobbies but – as importantly – someone who lost an extraordinary person fifteen years ago and that to know us well must be to understand, honour and never forget the resulting still-open incision in our souls.\nGive madness free reign\nOf course it’s not entirely mature to be found sobbing in bed mid-afternoon holding the stuffed huskie they gave you seven years ago from a shop at Oslo airport. But let’s not compound our losses by an unfair attachment to one’s dignity.&nbsp;\nSo write (but try not to send – or do…) that very long letter outlining to them why they must regret this. And then, a bit later, that other letter saying how much you adore them. Even write the letter you hope they are one day going to send you, filled with phrases like ‘I’m so deeply sorry. I see now, finally, how right you were; that you are the only person who can understand me, that I belong to you and to no other…’ Even make the wedding speech (‘after a few bumps in the road…’). There are no rules here.\nDon’t merely hate them\nAll the kind people around you have naturally tried so hard to convince you that they are no good. And they did – of course – behave abysmally at times, especially at the end. But in private, celebrate their gorgeousness. Idealise them until even you can sense that you’ve reached some limit to what others bluntly call reality. Adore them with infinite imagination until – eventually – it slowly starts to occur to you that you’ve lost an often quite annoying latterly very selfish human, rather than a celestial visitor with penetrating intelligence and beautiful hands.\nBreak the wise rules\nOf course you should never call them; naturally you shouldn’t beg them to return. It’s entirely necessary to block their number. But there are grave dangers in trying to be so grown up one never allows oneself to mature; there are certain blows to the ego from which one can only ever recover through unguarded humiliation. Make yourself abject and silly, try everything and watch it fail, observe yourself descending into a mockery of your former coherent self. Sink as deep as the pain commands.\nIf need be, stay ‘too long.’ Get back together seven times. Try to persuade them in lengthy phone calls. Live the impossibility; don’t just intellectually assume it and then suffer from your emotions never following suit. Properly experience why things can’t be until the lesson sinks in authentically rather than logically. Tire yourself back to health.\nNo one can make you wise one moment ahead of time – or in your place. The best way to recover sanity is to allow madness to have its full, unfettered, horrific, necessary run.",

In the past, we had to make do with broad brush complaints: we’d describe the maddening people in our lives as argumentative, sulky, weird or just deeply annoying. Now they are – with far greater authority and sober technical rigour – toxic, avoidant, borderline, co-dependent, trauma-bonded, paranoid-adjacent and (of course) narcissistic.\nCentral to this increase in specificity has been the discipline of psychotherapy. Therapy has devoted itself to the task of helping clients trace – with immense forensic skill – the pathologies of those they are closely involved with. It has democratised a dense vocabulary with which to turn unstructured unhappiness into an array of clinical symptoms.\n\nPhoto by Zachary Keimig on Unsplash\n\nThe approach has a degree of real merit. It can be highly salutary to get a firmer grip on the troubling dynamics of our romantic lives. There can be relief and new dignity in understanding that our partner has a maladaptive attachment style rather than just being a nag; or suffers from affect dysregulation rather than just being messy.\nThe difficulty is what happens next. There is – behind the therapeutic focus – a central unspoken assumption: that there are alternatives. And this is where the premise starts to show its weakness, for on closer examination, after an assiduous scouring of the landmasses of the globe, it emerges that more or less the entire human race, not just this or that admittedly profoundly pathological character we have been forced to deal with, partakes in what we may as well, without regard to professional decorum, call madness. Once we are done with rightfully expelling every last demented and unworthy partner from our domain, we may be extremely proud of how well we have followed the principles of emotional maturity; we may also be entirely alone.\nTherapy operates with a consoling ideology which for a heady moment seems to point us to liberation: it teaches us how to fathom and then expel ill people from our affections. But health turns out to be far rarer than we are being prompted to think. We are at risk of misconstruing as a normal condition a degree of emotional evolution that is in fact, in statistical terms, a momentous exception. We are implicitly being taught to interpret as anomalies behaviours that in fact belong squarely and unbudgeably to the tragic norm.&nbsp;\nWe have collectively been so busy charting what is wrong with people, we have forgotten to try to make a tenable life among those that in fact exist. Our critical powers have outstripped our educative ones; our skills at pathologising have surpassed our talents at managing.\nA priority of responsible therapy should therefore no longer be to inflame clients against the miscreants who cross their paths, but rather to guide them towards ways of generating a more less tolerable mindset with which to handle the imperfect beings who appear to be, after all, an indelible feature of planetary existence.&nbsp;\nWe are at present encouraged to believe that the prime explanation for why we put up with less than ideal treatment is because we have been the victims of early neglect that has trained us to expect far less of others than we naturally deserve. Though the logic is impeccable, it ignores an awkward dimension: that people go from one scratchy relationship to another not simply because they are unwell and traumatised (though they may be this too), but because there aren’t in fact very many wholly sound alternatives. In so far as one is going to have a relationship at all, it will – statistically speaking – almost by definition be with someone to whom one will be able to associate a fair number of the ‘red flags’ righteously discussed within therapeutic discourse. \nWe would know at once that there wasn’t much point in educating people in precisely how physically unattractive most humans are. We’d understand that it wasn’t useful or kind to guide them to better or more quickly identify asymmetries between the eyes or collapses of folds of skin under the chin. We’d know it wasn’t wise to sensitise ourselves to what cannot easily be altered; to problems that belong to reality. No less of a generosity of spirit should be mandatory in relation to our psychological shortcomings.\nThe real task of therapy should be to help us to develop a wry, calm regard for our partner’s follies and our own, to nurture a way of greeting the mess of the human animal without too much stunned alarm or incensed agitation.&nbsp;\nOur chances of meeting a partner who is normal are – in truth – close to zero, and therefore the focus on abnormalities can only ever prove so useful. If we can accept that madness is the rule, then dating and relationships would need to be spoken of in very different terms. Therapy would become about the management of imperfection, not (implicitly) about the quest for an ideal. \nOur relationships would still be troubled, but we would greet our crises with a host of tools that would – paradoxically – lighten our burdens substantially. We would learn to laugh, to divert ourselves, to be patient, to set turmoils in context, to sleep on problems, to confess to mutual folly; we would meet our fellow broken creatures with increased tolerance and a livelier sense of the cruelty and impossibility of self-righteousness. We would learn how to love by knowing that very few of us ever properly deserve love – but all of us stand in desperate need of it anyway.",

      "text": "News that two people who had a harrowing break-up are now trying to get back together again – a few months or years down the line – tends, among sensible people, to raise at the very least suspicion, if not outright irritation and despair. Why are these two cursed lovers heading back to the old chaos and drama? Isn’t this just a fantasy sprung from naivety, loneliness and – most probably – short-term lust? Shouldn’t they keep faith with their original choice, double down on the highs and lows of dating and – perhaps – each buy a dog?\n\nIsaac Israëls, Elegant Couple on the Terrace, c. 1865-1934\n\nAnd yet to deny ex-couples any legitimate chance to revisit their situation also feels excessively punitive and, in its way, naive. Insisting blindly that people can never change &#8211; that psychotherapy and introspection, books and conversations, time and long walks – have nothing whatsoever to teach us is as foolish as to assume that change can come readily and lightly. For every misguided attempt to resume a relationship, there must be a proportion of equally misguided refusals to countenance a new start, born not out of wisdom so much as pre-emptive fear and disbelief that people are occasionally able to learn a new thing or two.\nWe need – to make progress – a tool with which to strip the matter of sentiment and rationally distinguish mature from sentimental plans.&nbsp;\nWhat follows is a sequence of questions (amounting to an examination) that exes who are meeting up again after a long break should discuss with one another and as importantly with themselves before coming anywhere near to holding hands, let alone (and here we must be very definitive) going to bed. To the question, ‘should we meet up for dinner?’ the standard response should from now on be: ‘Let’s take The School of Life’s Re-Entry Exam first’.\nThe School of Life’s Re-entry Examination\nCan you meet me for a Re-entry Examination that may take up to seven hours over five separate meetings – and involve soliciting the views of two of our good friends as well?\nOne of the major signs that a relationship is viable is that both parties are willing to give up an unusual, even inordinate, amount of time, to the intellectual exploration of its past flaws. The more they can stand to examine the horror, the less it need to recur. The greatest predictor of success is an advanced capacity to think, without defensiveness, pride or impatience, about all that was most terrible.\nEverything that feels un-Romantic is, paradoxically, truly Romantic, in the sense of being conducive to love. Which is why the test is deliberately, provocatively framed in the most boring, hard-headed way possible. It should sound extremely forbidding and very unsexy. We concretely prove our love by being ready to discuss our feelings for hours with some of the tenacity of a lawyer and the steadiness of an accountant rather than abseiling down a clock tower with roses or making furious love in a hotel room.\nAre we here because we have learnt things or because we miss one another?\nThis is a highly binary and leading question and there is only possible answer. Opt for the wrong one and the exam is declared void immediately. Missing someone can be very moving. But it has nothing, strictly nothing, to do with a fitness to return. One can miss someone and know – or should know – that they are absolutely not a person ever to get close to again. One can both utterly regret a partner and not in any way benefit from being with them.&nbsp;\nOf course, someone might tell a lie at this juncture but at least it will be clear to them that they are having to deceive in order to proceed. No one can be in any doubt as the purpose of this exam: to search out, and probe at, signs of learning, rather than signs of love.&nbsp;\nHave we substantially changed since we were last together?\nTo put it even more bluntly: the only reason two people should ever attempt to restart a relationship is because something has fundamentally changed in them. Nothing else counts: that we once got on, that we almost had a child (or have five together), that we still know each other’s nicknames, that they look really very nice sitting across the table from us… The sole and exclusive reason to be exploring once more is because one feels one has learnt some very significant things in the interregnum.&nbsp;\nCan we ‘say’ why we have changed – at length and in depth – not merely ‘feel’ we have changed? Can we turn warm intentions into words, a lot of words?\nThe cynic tends to chip in at this point to add: anyone can ‘say’ they’ve changed, but what’s hard and what counts is to ‘show’ one has changed. Actions, not words are where it’s at. To which we’d say ‘yes, of course’ but also that people who can describe at some length (we are talking a minimum of five hours of conversation) about what is going on in them and hear what is at play in the other also have a good chance of following through at the level of action. Analytically-precise words are not always cheap, it’s not a simple matter to speak clearly about one’s past emotional immaturity and idiocy &#8211; and by the time people can, it is a sign of a certain dawning wisdom which can stretch beyond mere fine intentions. At the same time, we should be very suspicious of any ex who tries to pass off their reluctance to sit an exam or their unwillingness to speak as a small matter indicating nothing other than a personal preference: ‘I’m not so good with language, words fail me, I don’t do introspection very well, I love you but I can’t always say why…’&nbsp;\nWe’re sorry for such a person; we also know that they plainly do not merit another chance.&nbsp;\nWe both agree that this exam commits us to nothing whatsoever.&nbsp;\nIt’s an exploration, nothing more or less. Both parties have to recognise that they may have to walk away with nothing, and it won’t be anyone’s ‘fault’.&nbsp;\nWhy did we fight so much?&nbsp;\nWe’re coming to the core of the examination. It’s a luxury of couples who will never get back together again that they can concentrate on the good sides of their story. They can listen to songs and daydream about the sweet times without any need to remember reality. But for those who are thinking of getting back together, there is no alternative but to focus with immense intent on one aspect only of the relationship: what was properly awful about it (and there would have been a lot that was, given that people don’t ever sever a tight bond lightly). The priority is to identify, and then submit to rigorous analysis, all that was most nightmarish, all that it remains extremely painful and eerie to summon. A couple’s right to resume is to be measured against their courage in exploring why they failed.\nIn one column of a chart, we need to write up no fewer than three arguments, though it could be twenty or more. Then, because every argument involves a clash between two people’s fervent but violated sense of justice and rightness, we should fill in two adjacent columns: what felt so important to person A, and what felt so important to person B. We need to distill overall principles from the morass of specific circumstances. We’re looking not just for what each person said, but for the underlying value or principle that they were defending and that drove the conflict on to its miserable end.\n\n\n\n\nAppalling argument\nWhat was important to A\nWhat what was important to B&nbsp;\n\n\nA wanted to go out with their friends. B wanted A to stay at home.\nTo go out with friends independently without being ‘monitored.’\nThat a functioning ‘couple’ should do most things together.\n\n\nA was busy at work and didn’t text back.B wanted greater responsiveness over texts.\nTo be able to concentrate on work without feeling a need to placate the partner\nTo show, in small ways and large, that one is still a presence in the other’s mind, throughout a working day.\n\n\nA mentioned they’d be found attractive by someone at a party.B wanted no mentions of A’s appeal to anyone.\nTo be able to express sexual feelings and sense of attraction to people outside the couple.\nTo be very loyal sexually simply within the couple.\n\n\nA was upset but didn’t tell B. They hoped B would know.B got upset that they hadn’t been told explicitly – and got annoyed for being expected to know what they hadn’t been told.\nTo have a partner who can be sensitive enough to intuit without me speaking.\nTo be with someone who knows how to put their emotions into words and clearly communicate their anger not long after it’s arisen.\n\n\n\n\nWhy did I feel as impassioned as I did?\nThe breakup gives an opportunity for two people to explore the nature of their impassioned feelings – and in particular, the debt these may have owed to elements of their always tricky childhoods. There will – almost always – be a historical dimension to hysterical feelings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nWhat was important to me\nBackstory\n\n\nTo go out with friends independently without being ‘monitored.’\nBecause my mother never allowed me independence and my sister monitored everything I did.\n\n\nTo be able to concentrate on work without feeling a need to placate the partner\nI had to watch what my angry father was feeling at all times. I don’t want to have to second guess others’ moods all the time.\n\n\nTo be able to express sexual feelings and sense of attraction to people outside the couple.\nI haven’t had much of a chance to appreciate my sexual appeal. There’s a side of me that needs a chance to be a bit vain for a while.\n\n\nTo have a partner who can be sensitive enough to intuit without me speaking\nI didn’t learn to speak up because no one was interested in what I felt or had to say.\n\n\n\n\nHow would I do it differently now? What can I change about my views?\nOnce our impassioned positions have been identified and their origins explained, we may be readier to explore how we might surrender what we once took to be a non-negotiable part of our identities.\nWhat can’t I change?&nbsp;\nBut also: what coping mechanisms might we arrive at to deal with these unchangeable aspects?\nWe need to acknowledge that – almost certainly – we won’t be able to alter all of our personalities and this is the moment to get clear with our ex about what is and isn’t possible. Broken promises always exact a worse toll than than pre-emptively lowered expectations. What do we feel that we aren’t, despite a lot of goodwill, going to be able to overcome? And how – if at all – can these stubborn bits of our personalities be handled?\nHow much can we each bear of what won’t change?&nbsp;\nFrank answers can spare a couple decades of squabbling. What could we put up with? What remains – if we are honest with ourselves – something we would be better of never having to deal with?\nWhat trouble do I bring into the relationship? How am I difficult to live around?\nThere should no bristling here. Bearable people have a good handle on their unbearable dimensions. We don’t need people to be perfect; we just need them to have a decent sense of how imperfect they are – and how much their imperfections cause the other pain.\nWhat trouble do you bring into the relationship? How are you difficult to live around?\nWe need agreement on the mutual complications that are being brought to the table. Both people should write their answers down, then show the other their analyses. Can both sides agree on what is most horrible in each person? The more alignment there can be, the less future criticism has to feel like nagging; and the more it can fit into a kinder project of helping someone to change as they would (at their saner moments) wish to change.\nWhich bits of my anxiety and unhappiness did I discover were not after all your fault? What continued to be difficult even without you around?\nIt is highly tempting, when in a relationship, to assume that all the misery we face is the fault of the lover. We attribute to the main person in our lives a commanding role in determining our state of mind. But when they are gone, we may be forced to realise a more complex truth: that our low moods and neuroses have their origins in large part in us rather than in them. It can – oddly – no longer all be their fault. How did life remain hard even without them? What might they not be to blame for?\nWhat I now appreciate more properly about you is…\nWe’re meant never to lose sight of what was great about them, but in reality, we need the perspective of time to get clearer about their virtues. In the long months since we were together, what sides of them did we realise we most deeply valued?\nWhat did I learn from meeting other people?&nbsp;\nA truly tickly subject but as we are realising, it’s a capacity for eating humble pie that stands a restarted relationship in such good stead. What did the bad dates teach us? What did the rejections bring home to us? What did we learn from the flaws of others about the merits of the one we left behind?\nWhat will happen when we argue next time? Define six arguments that might take place in the future – and explore what could be done differently.\nDesign six arguments that might occur going forward:&nbsp;\n— There’s another party…\n— You’re busy at work again…\n— You’re tired and upset that they flirted…\nHow will we behave differently? What could we do other than break up? How might diplomacy replace warfare?\nEach person should approach one of their very good friends who lived the break up from close quarters and ask them to meet the ex in private, then provide a deep evaluation of the prospects for a successful return. Does this ex now feel safe? Should the couple do this?\nIt seems extremely odd to bring in a third party. We imagine that couples have all the answers to their own problems. But most people who survive a break up only do so because they have – somewhere in the background – a wise kind sceptical friend who listened to the sobbing, counselled when to text and when to block, was always on hand and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the entire trauma. It seems foolish not to benefit from this person’s experience – and inevitable degree of scepticism. They don’t want to go through another catastrophe all over again. Even better, they don’t love our ex, they won’t be going to bed with them, they only stand to face the downsides – and that is why they are so useful. They aren’t a sworn enemy (that won’t be of assistance) but nor are they any kind of indiscriminate romantic. They are a hard-headed realist who saw what the ex put their friend through and doesn’t ever want it to happen again.\nThey need to be brought into the discussion. They need a one-on-one meeting with the prospective partner (who should be very intimidated by the idea but go through it anyway in the name of love). If the partner can convince this battled-wearied person, true change will have occurred – and vice versa. The friend must assess the ex on the following points – and score them out of ten:\n— How much do the ex understand of the problems they brought into the relationship?\n— How much do they seem able to change?\n— What is their level of defensiveness?\n— What have they understood about themselves?\n— How might they manage conflict more successfully?\n— What do they appreciate about their ex?\n— Assess the overall viability of a return. In short, yes or no?\nWe take the gravest decisions of our lives on a whim. We will properly honour love and spare ourselves cycles of dismay and pain when we learn – at last – to disregard our desires and follow instead the pedantic dictates of sober, sensible, beautifully tedious logic.",

      "text": "Few things could sound as offensive and unromantic as to draw comparisons between hiring an employee – and getting together with a partner. \nWe’re highly attuned to the many differences between commercial recruitment and love: money plays an overt role in the first, ideally rather little in the second. One is about cold objectives and annual targets, the other about feelings and tenderness.\nBut we can end up emphasising the differences at our cost. An unhelpful nebulousness can afflict our search for love. We can fall prey to notions that it would be vulgar or unseemly to think directly about how to accomplish our ends, that we must trust in fate and keep things ‘old fashioned’. We may imagine that if someone was truly meant to be with us, they would – paradoxically – arrive in our lives with minimal intent on our part (the less we have to do, the more it was meant to be). \n\nPhoto by The Royal Danish Library on Unsplash\n\nBut when we look back at the embers of failed relationships, what often emerges is that we simply weren’t clear enough, with ourselves or with the other, as to what we needed. We failed to see that we had certain implicit requirements which we omitted to explore with necessary forthrightness.\nCompare this with our approach at work. It would be odd, when tasked with hiring someone, to conclude that we had to let time take its course. We understand the urgency. No less intense time pressures exists, in a more concealed form, in love (we need only ask an older person about the windows that lie between 20 and 30 and 30 and 40).&nbsp;\nWhen recruiting at work, we also have little compunction getting clear as to what a role entails. We understand that there are criteria and that it helps to list them. Somewhere inside, we have comparably defined requirements in love, we’re just a lot more hesitant about drawing them up. We might (let’s imagine) need someone who was:&nbsp;\n— Interested in psychology\n— Working on themselves\n— Ready to put a relationship above their friends\n— Settled in their careers\n— Neither having nor wanting children\n— Keen to travel\n— Attractive to us – which probably means not too tall and maybe with glasses.\nBut to draw out such criteria, we need to understand ourselves – and then feel sufficiently legitimate and confident about our wishes to dare go out into the world in search of them.\nWe should import into our hunt for love some of the unembarrassed state of mind that naturally accompanies us in the workplace. Why wouldn’t we use technological tools? Why wouldn’t we set aside a few hours regularly for the search? Why wouldn’t we tap our networks in undisguised ways? Why wouldn’t we – on dates – run through a prescribed set of questions (subtly delivered)?\nTo do anything less disregards the fundamental basis of our lives: that we have limited time.\nJane Austen would have understood. Every date is at heart a recruitment interview, for which we need to show up with a privately held brief and the right set of questions. The breadsticks and olives shouldn’t distract us: this is possibly the most serious work of our lives, given the contribution that love can make to life’s richness.\nThe best way to guarantee our finer, higher emotions may be to double down on their practical underpinnings: the best guarantor of love is a very un-Romantic mindset.",

      "text": "In many relationships, we may find ourselves asking, with continually renewed frustration, puzzlement and pain: ‘Why can’t they change?’ We ask because there is so much at stake. Because we have invested so much in them and they in us. We ask also because we know they are intelligent. They understand so much. They follow arguments, they ordinarily communicate in sophisticated ways. They may have attended a good university. Surely, surely then, they will be able to hear us and grasp what needs to be done.&nbsp;\nIt isn’t – after all – very complicated. We need them to be more reliable. We need them to call us when they say they will. We need them to kiss us more. We need them to ask us about our day. We need them to initiate sex sometimes. We need them to be softer and more focused. These are the signs that we need from them and upon which everything hangs: the survival of a relationship or a marriage, where children go to school, who owns a house, what’s in a will.\n\nPaul Kotlarevsky, Man Reading, 1916\n\nThe pain and strangeness is deepened because they don’t say a flat out ‘no.’ They insist – repeatedly – that they do love us. At points, they appear to listen to us. They don’t want the connection to unravel either.\nThe things we’re trying to get them to do have an elemental simplicity: a few more words here and there. Not those annoying behaviours. Some more gestures at key moments. You’d think this was entirely obvious. Not least because so many people – we included – have absolutely no problem with such matters; they come to us as readily as, to some, does the gift of mental arithmetic or a facility with language.\nWe suffer because we can’t, unlike in other areas of endeavour, ‘see’ or grasp the effort required to change psychologically. We know it’s hard to climb a very tall mountain. We know the limitations of our limbs and intuit how hard those granite sides will be – and so don’t find ourselves crossly saying: ‘Just go and climb K2’. But in the emotional realm, there are no visible markers of challenge. Why don’t they just reach out to us more, think of us more, hold us more…? It’s so simple. Except it’s not. Not for them at least. It would be as hard for these people to take this on board as it would be for us to run up a cliff face, levitate a car or fly between buildings. The difficulty may be traceless. It is every bit as real and as incontestable.\nWe have to accept something beyond the evidence of our senses – in the way we have to accept a principle of physics that defies the naked eye. We have accept that for a certain sort of person, to say a sentence like ‘I can’t live without you; I need you so much,’ though it’s made up of ten commonplace, non syntactically arduous words, is as much of a challenge as would be lifting up a tree with one’s little finger or flawlessly translating a text from Finnish to Korean in an instant.\nWhen we protest and say ‘why don’t they just…’, in our disbelief, there is so much that we’re not – at that moment ‘seeing’: the decades, especially the first one, that very slowly, over thousands of small incidents, with some of the patience of water shaping stone, moulded them into who they are. We’re not seeing the small boy or girl who had to cope with a father who left the family, or a mother who undermined them across long years. We’re not seeing how they had to adapt to make it through and why certain learned responses made sense. We’re not seeing that ‘character’ is a substance as tough as cat gut and as hard to alter as muscle. This has nothing to do with intelligence in the standard sense of an ability to understand an argument and respond to information. They can do this extremely well every day in their work, as we know. But this is of another order, it has to do with the way they were assembled as an emotional being, it touches on the wiring of their soul.\nWe can no more ‘just’ become a person who runs at a certain emotional temperature than we can be a person who ‘just’ competes in the Olympics or ‘just’ changes their eye colour. The difficulty doesn’t signal itself; it is every bit as concrete and unbudgeable as the most strenuous feats of the visible world.\nWe shouldn’t add to our suffering by believing that we are against some kind of stubbornness or wilfulness, that they are doing it on purpose, that we are destroying years on something that could change tomorrow. We need to dignify our problems. Our lives haven’t become unmoored by a haphazard matter or nastiness of character or streak of spite. We’re up against what we might as well learn to see as one of the central tripwires of existence. We’re facing the Pyramids of Giza or the direction of flow of the Rhine. They function in one kind of emotional way; we function in another. Despite a total lack of visual evidence, we’re fundamentally different people.\nWe would, to change them, need to put them in a time machine, fly back to the past and give them an entirely different upbringing. We’re insulting ourselves and the process by which people become who they are, to keep assuming that a few more paragraphs or one two more chats will do it.&nbsp;\nIf we need to leave them, and we may, let’s not compound our suffering by assuming it’s caused by negligible factors. We were trying to remake a human being, we were trying to bend the laws of time and space, we were attempting to retool DNA with our bare hands. How noble and how brave of us to try. How very normal that we ran into difficulties.",

It was hard to get around, life was narrow and judgemental, there wasn’t much to do in the evenings, the animals smelt – and so on and so forth.\n\nPieter Brueghel the Younger, A Village Fair, c. 1564 –1638\n\nBut there was one enormous advantage. When it came to settling down, there were so very few options to choose from. If you were 22 and a man, there’d be three candidates, maybe four – and vice versa – and once you were paired off, the task was simple: to do your very best simply to make it work. You understood immediately that the person wasn’t perfect, that this wasn’t the end of all imaginings, but the next village was a three days walk away across the mountains and your entire mindset was consequently oriented towards hope and accommodation. Yes, they might be a bit stubborn, yes they let out an odd whistling sound when sleeping, but they were clever enough at building sluices or moulding pots – and that wasn’t nothing. Of course, they were a bit obsessive about their mother but they were charming some of the rest of the time. And perhaps they weren’t ideal looking around their chin but does one even notice after a little while and how nice their hands were at least.\nWhereas now, far from those now deserted villages, not a second goes by without a mania and another glance. What about someone less… someone more… or not so…? Someone basically like what we’ve got – or had dinner with last week – but just a little bit younger, or older, or better built or without that thing about their teeth or slightly peculiar backside. And the machine doesn’t ever complain or rebuke, why would it, this malevolent slot machine surreptitiously hungering for our coins. Let’s take another lucky dip or ten or twenty. The casino is open 24 hours. Here’s someone from Sri Lanka, 39, a doctor who likes badminton and dogs. Don’t like dogs? OK, what about 32, an accountant, originally from Bremen… Not keen on Germans? What about this amazing one, a special of the week in fact, Dundee, still only 29 but so accomplished; a PhD from somewhere one doesn’t recognise but pretty spectacular in most ways.\nAnd it isn’t – naturally – just we who are looking in this way. We are only a momentary stop on everyone’s else’s marathon. A world swiping in the bath and at the gym, on the bus and on forest walks. We too – even in the intimacy of the bedroom – when we finally think we have a refuge, remain aware that the beloved still has their phone, still in the secret hours will be looking, will be sending the odd friendly greeting back (in a tone within the bounds of deniability). It isn’t a sign of madness to be paranoid, only a folly to be anything but. We’ve killed love in an unyielding search for it.\nWe may explode at points: I want none of it. I’m out of the funfair. I can’t take the fickleness. I can’t bear that no one sticks at it – as a parent will with a child, who isn’t going to be sent back on bad days. I want to go home.\nHow much we might long for a deity to stop the dance definitively, to take away these hideous illuminated carousels from our guilty hands and simply say to us, as if from on high, in an unquestionable divine voice: this one goes with that one; that one with that one. And that’s it, I brook no opposition. Make it work or face a thousand hellfires.\nWe’d hate it but at the same time, how calm we’d feel, how settled would be our lives. How free we would be, at last, knowing we had no choice but to love here and nowhere else – forever without end. We’d make it work.",

There are few outward signs of the quality Someone might ostensibly seem very grown up while still being stubbornly a young child inside. They might have have lots of degrees testifying to their ‘intelligence’ and yet still be highly primitive in their psychological functioning. They could be eloquent about the theory of sound psychological conduct – and hopeless about the practice.\n\nPhoto by Daniil Onischenko on Unsplash\n\nNevertheless, it can help to at least begin with a sense of what it is we should be looking out for in terms of markers of emotional maturity, so that we may know as early as possible who we have on our hands and what our options might be.&nbsp;\nHere are some of the key questions we might ask ourselves of our new partners:\n1. Could this person bear the terrors of opening themselves up to another’s love and acknowledge without too much fear the depth of their need for someone else? Could they let you look after them? And in turn could they look after you? Could they bear to love without holding on to excessive independence? Could they temper their dread of being engulfed? Could they be part of a couple without feeling they were dissolving as a person? Could they avoid managing fear through coldness or suspicion and anger? Could they, in short, manage the anxieties of being adored? Or if we can put it another way: could they not hold it against you if you liked them a lot?\n2. Could this person understand what they were feeling? In other words, when their feelings were complicated, in the sense of being less than acceptable to them in relation to their self image, could they nevertheless perceive that they were (for example) angry or sad, sexually restless or envious? Could they regularly (every day) put aside distractions and go into themselves to ask: What is going on for me? Could an observer-self inside them be able to listen to the hubbub and murmurs of their unconscious? Could they write a convincing diary entry titled: how I am feeling?\n3. Could they have the strength of mind and faith in dialogue to be able to tell you the difficult things about themselves? Could they avoid sentimentality and obfuscation, lies and prevarications? Could they calmly and diplomatically talk you through their complexities? Could they be trustworthy enough to be able to explain themselves cleanly if ever they needed to leave you?&nbsp;\n4. Could they take criticism without defensively reading it as an unfair attack or proof of being disliked? Could they accept that they – like everyone else – had much to learn? \n5. Could they have understood a sufficient amount about their pasts not to project onto you an anger, a suspicion or a longing that would more rightly have been meant for someone else, probably a disappointing mother or father long ago?&nbsp;\n6. Could they have accepted the fundamental premises of psychotherapy: that we are all damaged by our childhoods, that we all have issues we need to work on, that we all have to apologise for ourselves on a more or less daily basis, that we must all be committed to learning – and that we should all probably be a bit embarrassed of who we were last year?\nBut then, when we are done with asking questions of the other person, we should turn and direct a few equally probing enquiries at ourselves:\n1. Could we bear for a pleasing seeming candidate to turn out to be – in fact – rather wrong?\n2. Could we go back to the drawing board and wait exactly as long as was needed in order to find the necessary grown up candidate?\nIt’s part of true adulthood to be able to absorb with courage the idea that unless the constituents of emotional maturity are in place in a person, however seductive, funny, beautiful, rich or accomplished they might be, however fun the sex or exciting the first minibreak, a relationship with them is unlikely to prove salutary or worthwhile. It is an ultimate proof of maturity and loyalty to ourselves to be able to say, whenever the occasion demands it, a polite and prompt goodbye.",

      "text": "We humans have an immense appetite for complicated things. Neuroscience, astrophysics and molecular biology of course. But also barely decipherable books, abstract works of art and avant garde pieces of theatre without plot or character – all of which perhaps evoke the primordial puzzles of the universe and our own always ineffable existence within it.\n\n\n\nBut our veneration for complexity can reach a most painful, time consuming and futile zenith in one area in particular: relationships. It is here that we find otherwise discerning and hard-headed people exhibiting extreme patience – often lasting over a succession of tormented years – for what we can call ‘complicated situations.’ The complexities may arise from some of the following dynamics:\n— A beloved partner who wants to commit and surely will one day, but not quite yet (on account of this or that factor) or not entirely (because of certain psychological fears) or not conclusively or at least not without certain important caveats (they may need space, freedom or what they call ‘a chance to explore’ – though quite what, we’re still not wholly clear, though we have asked them on many, many occasions).\n— A partner with whom there are a lot of misunderstandings; around whom words often lose their standard meanings, around whom we may have to spend hours untangling what was truly meant and around whom gestures or deeds that we previously thought uncontentious suddenly become the occasion for major surprising aggravations.\n— A partner who in principle is there for us and in theory loves us very, very much, but in actuality (like last week and the week before that) is constantly remarkably busy, unable to respond to messages, out with their compelling friends or concentrated on their extremely demanding job.\n— A partner with whom we sit up late at night on many occasions, with a pad and paper to hand, attempting to determine where the issues are coming from, what is at play and how things might be handled before – baffled and upset – we finally retreat to bed a little after 1am, feeling fragile and tearful.\n— A partner whom we find ourselves discussing at almost every turn with our close friends and our therapist, speculating with concentrated energy on what drives them, who they might really be, why they do what they do, how their childhood could have affected them, what their attachment style is, what their most recent antic might truly ‘mean’, all the while peering at them as if they were a mysterious nebulae in an outer galaxy whose workings would concentrate the minds of the most erudite and sophisticated astronomers. \n— A partner who leaves us wondering whether we are not fundamentally daft and broken and pouring over all that we may have done wrong without meaning to: Have we offended them? Are we too demanding? Have we exhibited too little patience for their way of thinking? Perhaps, as they have told us, we want too much, maybe – as they hint – we are being unreasonable. We may never have felt more odd or damaged to ourselves than around this target of our affection.\nAll this – society sometimes seems to tell us – can just be what love is. No relationship is easy; no human is simple, everything needs hard work. \nIt is precisely because this is so often very true that we can omit to notice when, on other occasions, it has in any way ceased to be so; when certain sensible mantras about effort have subtly and dangerously turned into excuses for patience with people entirely unsuited to the business of mutual love.\nTo dampen some of our risky enthusiasm for emotional complexity, we might remind ourselves of a broad principle operating in relationships that we could term grandly The Rule of Simplicity. This states that in two people who are adequately mature, who have what it takes to function emotionally, who are feasible propositions, love will – overall, taken with perspective – be simple. Yes, there will be certain difficult conversations to be had every now and then, a few tricky moments and a constant requirement for practical effort. But, in essence, there will be a simplicity at play because of a few fundamentals at the heart of the union: they know how to, and want to, love us. And we know how to, and want to, love them.\nThat’s why they will pretty much always show up on time, answer messages promptly, communicate clearly, be proud of us, tell their friends about us and leave us feeling wanted, calm, sure of our position and able to go to bed (without checking our phones once more) at a sensible hour. Anything less is – we might generalise – a strong indication of something else. Quite what may be a matter for speculation lasting several centuries: it could be a childhood trauma, a mental condition, a consequence of our own misfounded appetites or the result of a tricky bond with a mother or father. But maybe we don’t in the end need to know precisely what is at work. Maybe we can (to follow the rule) just read the complexity as an indication that we shouldn’t be here.\nIt might be time to stop glorifying questions: where were they? What do they mean? When will they call? If they love us, we will know it. If they want to be there, they will show up. There is only so complicated a relationship ever needs to be. When it is viable, love is – all told – fairly obvious.\nIf we find ourselves in a union in which were are up all night writing journal entries or peering through our telescope at the latest ambiguous signal, it might be nothing more or less than proof that we have outrun the patience that we should fairly be exhibiting towards any human being. Or, to follow the Rule of Simplicity and to speak more directly, we may just need to get out now.",

We may have to pay close to a month’s salary for dropping a napkin in a park or driving at 22mph down a clear dual carriageway at 3am.\nBut there is one area in our regulated world where few laws exist. In relationships, unless there is violence or egregious abuse, there are no ‘rules’ to speak of. We can with impunity spend eight years with someone and then, just as all their other options have closed, politely tell them that we’ve fallen in love elsewhere and walk out by nightfall &#8211; and there is nothing the forlorn party can do (other than weep and lose their minds).\nBut even if no legal sanctions exist, this does not mean that notions of right and wrong cease to apply. There are a host of rules around ending relationships that all decent people understand &#8211; and here, framed for our consciences, are eight of the most important:\n\nMelancholy, Edgar Degas, 1874, Wikimedia Commons. \n\nAn Ethical Code for Ending Love\n1. Hurt them unbearably if you need to; don’t in addition steal any more of their time than necessary. It’s particularly unkind to pretend not to have noticed that a partner might have only a limited window in which to marry, start a family or reconfigure a career. The first instant that you realise it’s not working is the instant to tell them it’s not working, not after the return from the holidays or towards the end of next year or, maybe, the year after that. Don’t &#8211; on top of it all &#8211; rob them of a future.\n2. Adore them immeasurably &#8211; or get out. If you’re not fully proud of them, allow someone else to be. If you really suspect you could do ‘better’, go out and do so. Know that your Plan B could &#8211; right now &#8211; be someone else’s Plan A. Love deeply or not at all.\n3. Perhaps one can’t stop developing unfaithful thoughts; there’s very little obligation to act on them. Don’t add the toll of betrayal to the miseries of abandonment.\n4. Don’t force them to end the relationship when it’s you who want to get out. Don’t express your discomfort through ambivalence and a luke warm manner until they get so upset, they eventually have to exit for their own survival. Say you’re fed up when you are, don’t evasively hint as much, then tell them you love them when they ask. Don’t make them doubt their sanity by framing them as the one who wants to exit when they’re deeply in love. Don’t give them the guilt to carry for what you want, but are too cowardly, to do.\n5. It hurts so much more when we don’t quite know why a partner is leaving; we keep thinking it might be a mistake &#8211; and that they will soon come to their senses. So give the ex a coherent explanation for why it simply can’t, and never will, work, one that will feel robust in the middle of the night &#8211; and spare them the pains of boundless rumination. If you’re old enough to be in a relationship, you are old enough to say in plain terms why you want to exit.\n6. Stop trying too hard to be ‘nice’. Allow them &#8211; at least for a while &#8211; to dislike you. They need to develop the necessary resentment to save themselves. Don’t &#8211; on top of it all &#8211; insist on rescuing your self-image.\n7. Get out of their way. They have proper friends, they don’t need an ambiguous figure to make them feel repeatedly unsure where they stand. Every ongoing sweet gesture is at risk of being misinterpreted as a sign of hope. Allow yourself &#8211; where necessary &#8211; to be forgotten.&nbsp;\n8. Don’t pretend that there are no rules. They exist no less clearly than the ones that are on the statute books &#8211; and the tribunal of ordinary decency knows it. Retain your humanity through one of the most painful moments that you will ever put anyone through. And pray that someone else will do the same for you if &#8211; and probably when &#8211; your turn comes around.",

      "text": "Life is inherently filled with frustrations but how we interpret these frustrations &#8211; what we take them to mean, who we think is responsible for them and how we opt to complain about them (or don’t) &#8211; is fascinatingly diverse.\nOne of the best guides to the differences lies in the work of the American psychologist Saul Rosenzweig who in 1934 came up with what has become known as the Rosenzweig Frustration Test, a series of cartoon-like images showing people facing a range of vexing situations: someone’s clothing has been splashed; a vase has gotten broken; a fellow spectator’s head is in the way at the cinema…\nIn every case, we are given an empty speech bubble to complete &#8211; inviting us to show how we might characteristically behave were the world to trample on one of our hopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the test instantly reveals is that though frustration may be universal, responses to it are anything but. When their clothing has been splashed, one person might say with relative nonchalance: ‘Don’t worry, I’m sure you didn’t mean it’. Another might reply in a tightlipped way: ‘It’s absolutely fine. No problem at all’. While a third might burst out: ‘You bloody idiot, look what you’ve gone and done. You’re trying to destroy me, like everyone always is.’\nThe test highlights the role that self-esteem typically plays in responses to frustration. The more we dislike ourselves (almost certainly because someone close to us didn’t like us very much in childhood), the harder it is to read frustration as anything other than a deliberate attempt to hurt us. Of course people are trying to splash us, given who we are! Naturally everyone is trying to ruin our experience at the cinema, given that we’re not good enough and never were &#8211; ever since our father or mother powerfully suggested as much in our preschool years. Wouldn’t it be normal that someone would try to break our favourite vase, were they to guess &#8211; as they surely can &#8211; at the repugnant nature of our soul? Bad things logically and necessarily happen to bad people.&nbsp;\nCorrespondingly, the more we have been taught &#8211; in our first home &#8211; that we are fundamentally decent and valuable people, prone to the odd mistake but neither damned nor sinful, the more setbacks can strike us as innocent accidents, rather than plots or retributive acts. Why would someone try to destroy our nice clothes, when we have done nothing especially wrong and have generally noble intentions towards the world? Why would anyone harm a good enough person? Accidents are far easier to believe in when we don’t carry around with us &#8211; in pained layers of the unconscious &#8211; a lingering sense of our unworthy natures.\nAlong the way, the test helps us to measure our relative capacities to express pain. Must we always pretend that everything is fine? Or are we sometimes allowed to let out a cry? But what kind of cry can it be? A dignified bounded complaint that allows us to hold on to our esteem? Or a titanic roar that injures us as much as it does our offender &#8211; because we have had so little experience of mastering our own anger and because we have no secure sense of the legitimacy of our dispute? As ever, our past directs our responses: the child who was able to cry for a while, and with sufficient sympathy, when their toy broke or a school friend ate too much of their birthday cake may mature into an adult who can combine honesty with self-control. They neither have to say nothing; nor put on a dramatic performance in which all the hatred and injustice that has ever been heaped on them seeks a desperate and sudden way out.\nThe Frustration Test doesn’t ideally only tell us how we relate to frustration now. It holds open the possibility that, through self-awareness and much kindly and patient exploration of our childhoods, we may learn to respond a little more wisely and calmly, compassionately and thoughtfully, to all the obstacles large and small that will inevitably continue to come our way every remaining day of our lives.",

      "text": "We might expect that the most natural response to being told by a kind, patient and attractive person that they loved us would – after a small intake of breath – be to believe them. But little in our emotional makeup is ever quite as simple as it could be.\nIn order to trust that someone who tells us of their love is sincere – isn’t slyly mocking us, about to change their mind, in touch with someone else, or harbouring intentions to betray us or die – a lot needs to have gone right early on. For a significant number of us, a declaration of love – while intensely welcome in theory – can’t avoid feeling at some level unbelievable, peculiar and daunting and will therefore set up a violent oscillation between hope and despair, trust and fear, longing and scepticism.\n\nVilhelm Hammershøi, Portrait of the Artist&#8217;s Sister, 1885\n\nWe may call it anxious attachment, but this is too polite a term for what should, based on the behaviour it inspires on the ground, really be called angry attachment. In the face of love, some of us need to aggressively and explosively test what we are being given at every turn. We may need to break up with our lover eight times in a year, not because we really want to but because each occasion allows us to experience a cathartic dose of pure panic and then relief that the one we adore will have us back. We may feel compelled to make a jealous scene every time our partner goes out with a friend because we can’t deep down believe they could really love us and them. If they treat us to a nice meal or a present, we may unconsciously opt to puncture the mood and engineer a crisis – just to signal that we can’t easily be hoodwinked. We might accuse them of having betrayed us online and won’t be convinced otherwise until they’ve been submitted to hours of interrogation. Being in a drama can feel like the most relaxing of our options. It can be very painful for everyone.\nIn the past of the anxiously attached person, there will have been fierce threats to love’s integrity which will have made a vigilant stance feel like the only way to remain safe. Unlike the avoidant, the anxiously attached have experienced love, but they will have had to suffer grave dangers too: someone dying or going away, someone changing their mood or finding a new family to live with. The moral of childhood was that love can exist but never reliably and so must be permanently watched over with the ferocity of an Alsatian.&nbsp;\nThe tragedy is that in their desperation to see if something is solid, the anxiously attached may end up – entirely unnecessarily – shaking it to pieces. A partner who may have started off with every intention of loyalty might – after being constantly badgered about their intentions – eventually start to wonder if they might not be better off with someone else. After the hundredth time of being doubted, a partner may in the end give off some serious reasons for doubt.\nIf the anxious can accept that their condition isn&#8217;t a sign of random sickness but is the result of a very identifiable sort of upbringing, they may develop the courage one day to explain their fears to a partner (and first, of course, to themselves). They can, without shame, teach their beloved that they don’t mean to be so cross, they’re just worried. They don&#8217;t want to doubt them, they simply don’t know how not to. They don’t want to have to keep breaking up, they can’t believe that things could be viable. As their partners will ideally eventually realise, they may need to be told – in the very nicest of ways, as they once again develop a terror or engineer a drama – to stop thinking, be quiet, and surrender to a very, very tight hug. \nThe more they understand the origins of their behaviour, the more the anxious can perceive that it has outlived its uses. It may have made real sense to cling angrily to a parent at the age of five. They can be proud of the younger version of themselves for determining such a clever defensive strategy. But they can then also thank them gently and tell them that they have the situation in hand, and so can relax and enjoy some of the ease that should have been theirs from the start. The catastrophe the anxious fear will happen has already happened; it won’t – with a few standard adult precautionary measures in place, which have nothing to do with any need for ongoing theatrics or anger – ever need to happen again.",

      "text": "One of the most perplexing of all our behaviours is our tendency – in relationships – to flee from the warmth and affection it is so natural for us to want. In the face of someone who seems to like us very much, who smiles tenderly at us whenever we walk in the room and is interested in the details of our lives, some of us may respond in an extremely counterintuitive way: by feeling nauseous and (in time, probably) running away.\n\nJean Metzinger, At the Cycle-Race Track, 1912\n\nTo understand this kind of emotional avoidance, we might draw an analogy with food. Let’s imagine someone who grew up in an impoverished setting with a severely restricted diet: they had no option but to get used to only the smallest meals. The only way to survive was to need nearly nothing.&nbsp;\nWe might assume that, when finally presented with abundance, this person would eagerly try to make up for lost time. But of course the very opposite occurs. Their digestive system, having adapted to scarcity, cannot process the richness before them. The very sight of a full plate may generate anxiety; they may fall ill in the face of the plenty they had so long desired.\nSo too in love, those among us who grew up in households where affection was severely rationed may principally have learnt to want very little from other people. When a partner expresses immense interest in our day, we may feel suffocated rather than cared for. When someone wants to spend every evening together, we can feel trapped rather than wanted. When our lover expresses admiration, we can experience inadequacy rather than satisfaction. If someone speaks to us of marriage, our first temptation may be to go and flirt with an ex. Our discomfort is a central legacy and indicator of our deprivation.\nIf we can accept that our condition isn’t a sign of evil but simply the result of a certain sort of melancholy upbringing, we may develop the courage one day to explain the situation to a partner (and first, of course, to ourselves). We can, without shame, teach our beloved that the kindest thing they might be able to do for us is not to be too kind to us or at least not too soon; the most generous thing would be not to be too abundant. We want their love for sure, but we require it in very small doses and not all at once. We are going to need time on our own, there shouldn’t be too many hugs, compliments should be spaced apart. We appreciate the loveliness, we just need to take it in with a teaspoon.\nUnderstanding why love has to be titrated like this helps to move our other partner away from feeling insulted, and then getting angry and perhaps resorting to pejorative descriptions of our avoidant condition (commitment phobia, fear of intimacy etc.). We can both know that our way of approaching love was at the outset a very logical and intelligent adaptation to conditions of emotional scarcity that we didn’t choose – and that has nothing to do with meanness or pathology. \nAt the same time, the more we can we understand the genesis of our sense of being overwhelmed, the more we stand eventually to perceive that our caution has outlived its uses. We may be able to bear the ecstasy and plenitude of mutual love, we may no longer need to protect ourselves so assiduously against what nourishes and heals us.",

      "text": "We know – of course – that they urgently need changing. Where do we start with the problems? They are chronically late, emotionally withdrawn, excessively social, too easily influenced, appallingly untidy, frustratingly distant – just to start the list.\nOur complaints may well be entirely accurate; what we should notice is how utterly fruitless they also are. We have perhaps berated our partner, delivered them ultimatums, sent them angry emails in the night – and still they carry on as always. Changing people is evidently no straightforward business.\n\nVictor Pasmore, Lamplight, 1941\n\nTo preserve our energies, we need to start elsewhere. We should regain a sense of agency by focusing on something we can control and are far better able to effect: ourselves.&nbsp;\nHere are seven ways in which we can improve our relationships not so much by asking them to evolve as by altering the mindset we approach them with:\nTell them how it feels\nInstead of telling them sharply to amend their behaviour, we can try to explain – gently – a bit more about what it’s like to be on the receiving end of it. It can be a good deal easier to sympathise with a hurt person than a cross one, a scared person than a furious one. We should take them upstream from our rage and explain what it is like for us when they’re late or when they spend so much time with their friends or don’t answer our messages promptly. We can help them to witness our underlying sadness and anxiety rather than confronting them with our vindictiveness and fury.\nAsk them why they do it\nThe natural assumption is that they are doing it principally to hurt us. They know we are bad and are out to punish us. But we should replace some of our dark certainties with curiosity. In a way we have probably never done before, we can ask them why it seems so important to them to focus so much on their friends, or why they have such a need to prove themselves at work or are so often late. What do these things mean to them? How have they come about? There may be some very moving origins to what our partners are up to – entirely unrelated to them seeking to annoy or punish us. Their behaviour may not change; what it means to us (and therefore how we respond to it) can be transformed.\nSee it as the weakness of their strength\nWe can wonder to what good qualities their most frustrating traits are related. The bad sides of people are almost always connected up with positive characteristics somewhere else in their personalities. A lack of punctuality can be the downside of an openness of spirit. People-pleasing may be the downside of empathy; the vice of rigidity can be an unfortunate fruit of the virtue of reliability. Once we draw the links between flaws and their upsides, we can see that our moments of frustration have a psychological necessity about them which can inspire greater patience and forbearance; we are paying the toll in one area for something very good in another.&nbsp;\nHope a little less\nWe must price in problems to stop us being surprised by them at every turn. Pessimism is a friend of love. We have come together with a deeply imperfect person, not by simple bad luck, but by robust laws of human nature. Because anyone we get close to is fated to be, in areas, maddening to us (as we are to them). Because there are – tragically – in the end simply very few perfect people at large on the earth.\nDevelop a nickname for every maddening trait\nTurn tears into laughter. Transform every deeply annoying trait into a source of (wry) comedy. Try giving them a name that is the very opposite of the flaw that agonises you; consider the sources of the most persistent arguments and then baptise them, for example, Little Miss Punctual, Mr Organised, Mrs Open and Vulnerable, Mr Straightforward, Frau Curious or Signor Empathy. As Oscar Wilde knew: ‘If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they&#8217;ll kill you.’\nBe nice to them when you can\nThey have maddened us so much, of course. Friendliness is hardly going to come easily. But we thereby dig ourselves into an even greater hole, because in so far as people ever change, they do so not when they are shouted at, called fools or compared unfavourably with their siblings, but when they are encouraged, forgiven, sympathised with and &#8211; if we can put it simply – loved. If we refuse this path, it’s often because we imagine that it will entail being taken advantage of. But niceness doesn’t have to be conflated with weakness or surrender, it may just be what works.\nWe can always get out\nKnowing that it doesn’t have to go on forever may – paradoxically – be what helps us to keep going. We can remember our freedom so as to make our presence feel willed and appropriately conditional. We’re trying for now. We’ll do our best – until, or unless, we can’t any longer.\nWhat adds to our panic in love is typically the sense that we have surrendered our agency to a person who both pains us and escapes our control. But it always lies in our power to recover the initiative – from altering the way we speak to acknowledging our power to leave. Improvements in our relationships may stem not so much from attempting to reshape our partners into different people as from reshaping our responses to the people they already happen to be.",

      "text": "We don’t typically imagine that sexual deviants have very much to teach us about anything. We tend to read of their antics, sigh at their strangeness, and move on, as puzzled as we are sickened.\nBut this is to miss out on a disquieting reality: these deviants are manifesting in an extreme form proclivities in which we are all to some extent implicated. Behind such varied phenomena as exhibitionism, voyeurism, sexual murder and zoophilia lies a dynamic that sounds almost shocking in its apparent mundanity: a fear of intimacy. What distinguishes sexual deviants is not so much the fear of intimacy itself as its intensity, the extent to which a discomfort at human connection can come to inspire the most radical kinds of harm.\n\nStill from Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s Rear Window, 1954\n\nTake the exhibitionist. With their rain coat and abrupt unsolicited exposures in parks or city streets, they are at heart attempting to master a dread of rejection – by ensuring that it will occur at a time and in a manner of their own choosing. They transform the ordinary passive human anxiety at potentially being unwanted by someone they know into an active desire to cause certain revulsion in strangers – normally because they have, somewhere in their past, been made to suffer a devastating letdown by an early caregiver. Their antics constitute a particularly intense bid for control; if one is to be rejected, better to orchestrate the rejection oneself rather than risk the unpredictability involved in a two-way encounter. They chose to frighten someone they can disdain instead of running the risk of being humiliated by an intimate who, at a time and in a manner of their choosing, may fail to reciprocate their desires. They would rather make absolutely sure they will be met with horror rather than risk what feels to them like the even greater threat of foiled hope.\nThe voyeur demonstrates a comparable manic defence against closeness. Their need to limit sex to observation from across a calculated distance represents an extreme version of the more widespread fear of entering into a properly mutual relationship in which one can see and also be seen. Though we may not study our neighbours through a telescope, we may still recognise echoes of the voyeur’s drives in our hesitation to make eye contact in bed, in our greater ease with pornography than actual sex and in our interest in unavailable partners.\nIt’s in cases of sexual murder that the fear of intimacy manifests itself in its most catastrophic forms. The person who immediately has to kill the person they’ve had sex with is driven by a wish to extinguish any chance of reciprocity. They have to eliminate the very existence of the one who has witnessed them, in order to remove an untenable prospect of being judged, disapproved of and abandoned. Only death promises to alleviate the killer’s panic about negative appraisal and loss. But however horrific murder may be, it is still on a continuum with what many of us may do in more innocent ways after love making (the closest encounter of which we humans are capable) when, for example, we are beset by a sudden need to find another lover or to go to the opposite side of the bed and absorb ourselves in our screens, lest we be overwhelmed by the tenderness we’ve just been party to.\nThe terror of reciprocity can be played out across different species. The zoophile’s choice of non-human objects represents an attempt to avoid what feels to them like the appalling possibility of being seen, understood, or judged by a corresponding consciousness (an analogous pathological concern being at play in those who target children).\nHowever dispiriting such cases may be, they serve to illuminate something profound about all relationships. Whenever we notice ourselves keeping our distance, flinching at declarations of love, or deliberately not answering our partner’s messages after a warm evening together, we are being visited by milder versions of a related fear of being dependent on another.&nbsp;\nInterpreting pathological cases can help us to recognise and gently address our barriers to connection. In some of the most shocking behaviours of which humans are capable, we can trace magnified versions of our own ongoing difficulties balancing a need for connection with a discomfort at being properly seen, known and accepted.",

      "text": "It sounds odd to suggest that one of the things we may most long for, and in a sense even need, in a relationship is a chance ‘to be bad.’\nWe associate love with kindness, good behaviour and politeness. Anything less is liable to raise powerful suspicions; we have been highly sensitised to varieties of wickedness in intimate life.\nNevertheless, we might insist that a chance to be accepted in our less than edifying moments (when we are feeling scared, tired or defeated, when we can no longer bear to be reasonable or docile) also belongs to love – just as to be placed under an overly powerful and remorseless requirement to be ‘good’ can become an unkindness of its own. \n\nAlexander Bogomazov, The Artist&#8217;s Daughter, c. 1928\n\nTo understand the longing, it pays to look at the way parents handle their children. One of the things that sound parents know to do is accept that no child – indeed no human – can ever be angelic all the time and that to insist that they should be constitutes a denial of their basic reality. \nThe good parent stays steady in the face of certain sorts of tricky behaviour; if the child says they don’t want to see granny or wants to burn down the school or absolutely hates their little brother or wants to be the cleverest or most beautiful person in the world. The child may fling themselves on the floor and say they hate everyone or that they will never ever do their homework and the parent will exhibit a distinct and noble maturity when they don’t panic, don’t rage and don’t lose their composure. When they simply say: ‘It sounds like poppet is having a pretty tough day’. Or: ‘shall we have a think about this again in the morning?’ Or: ‘Ok, that sounds like a fascinating plan, but I think it might be time for bed.’ Or when they just pretend they haven’t quite heard and move on.\nTo love is not to confront someone with the full might of moral judgement at all times, it is to be able to bear something less than ideal at points.\nThere is an irony here. The more we have been shown benevolence as children, the less we will still be craving for it in adulthood. The child who has had to be too good too early, who has always had to hold their tongue, who has had to be extremely sweet and ‘grown up’ so as not to offend a pedantic, fragile and ungrown up caregiver, will be left with an acute dilemma in adulthood.\nThey will know that sweetness can get them the interest of others, but they won’t just want to be loved for their admirable qualities. In order to feel properly cared for and in order to be capable of genuine affection back, they will want to be tolerated for the full scope of their true selves, which will necessarily include instances of difficulty.\nThey want to be able to say, when a feeling of despair descends: ‘I am so stifled in this relationship and want to get out’ – not because this is the last word on the subject, but because a deep commitment to someone has to be inseparable from passing claustrophobia.\nOr: they might want to say: ‘Sometimes i feel so clingy I don’t want to let you have a single friend of your own’ – and this is obviously not the last word on the subject either, but it’s a necessary moment of all-consuming, infantile dependence that also needs an airing.\nWe might say, the journey to true maturity has to pass through the arch of immaturity, the road to true kindness and sweetness has to allow, at points, byways into fantasies of selfishness and meanness. Let’s be clear, we are talking fantasies rather than enactments, and trickiness rather than malevolence, but the proposal is that no one can feel spontaneously warm if they have not also been allowed to feel spontaneously very fed up.\nIt’s people who haven’t been able to say that they sometimes want to leave a relationship who will be at greater risk of one day silently packing their bags and doing so. It’s people who have never been allowed to speak in silly, extreme, or untrue ways who may one day buckle under the pressures of obedience and lose their moorings more substantially. The greatest defence against actual badness is to allow ideas of badness to circulate in the couple without unleashing disaster.\nThe good parent has an imperturbable side. And we do our lovers an immense favour when we can import this same quality into our encounters with the unfinished bits of their childhoods. The question ‘in what areas do you wish you had once been allowed to be bad in your early years?’ tells us a huge amount about where someone had to comply too soon and where we may be richly rewarded for our forbearance.\nA degree of indulgence seems also – in the end – to belong near the core of love.",

      "text": "Giuseppe de Nittis, Winter Landscape, 1880\n\nIt’s early morning in the middle of winter and we’re in a northern suburb of Paris in 1880. It’s been snowing all night and now the day has begun with a leaden grey sky and the air with the preternatural cleanliness and hush that follows a heavy fall. One can hear with new clarity the crows in the trees and the trains as they cross the viaduct. We’re up above the scene, in the company of the painter, a now largely forgotten Neapolitan called Giuseppe de Nittis, taking in the view from a second storey window.\nWhat draws our eye is a solitary woman in black, armed with nothing but a broom against the whiteness. There is something quietly heroic about her presence. While others remain sensibly indoors, adding logs to the fire and postponing their encounters with the cold, she has ventured out to perform her near Sisyphean task. Her broom will make only the most temporary impression on the snow&#8217;s glacial insistence.\nThe woman isn&#8217;t depicted as either a victim or a warrior; she&#8217;s just doing what needs to be done, like billions before and after her. Lacking any grandeur, there&#8217;s nevertheless a distinct nobility about her. Here is humanity as we seldom allow ourselves to see it: neither triumphant nor defeated, but doggedly persisting &#8211; despite so many arguments against it.\nPerhaps what we&#8217;re really looking at is a portrait of hope – the quiet, daily kind that sends us out into the elements to face dispiriting odds. It&#8217;s an image that nudges us to be a little kinder to ourselves and others, to recognise that merely continuing, merely showing up with our inadequate brooms against the cold, deserves to be counted as a victory of sorts. We’ll sweep even if the path will be covered again by nightfall.",

      "text": "Sometimes, without anything being explicitly said, couples come to certain remarkably awkward and sinister agreements between them about who might do what in the relationship. Among the most distinctive and painful of these agreements is when one person effectively says to another: ‘Could you be extremely needy and anxious so that I can be invulnerable and detached? Could you be wondering where I am all the time and where we are headed so that I can feel wanted but not in need? Can you &#8211; in effect &#8211; carry all the risks of love for me?’\nOn a typical day in such a relationship, person A may be left worrying about when person B will come back home and they’ll be told that they shouldn’t be so demanding, because there are some friends in town and who knows when the evening will end? Or person A will look at their phone waiting and waiting for a message that was due ‘no later than midday’ but still hasn’t come through by mid-afternoon &#8211; and will feel that they are losing their mind. Or person A will be made to feel that person B’s work is so important and leaves no room for anyone except of course B’s friends, who give a lot of parties and often invite B out (but not really A). Constantly, A feels like they are chasing B &#8211; and B is off-hand, cool, and elsewhere.\nThere tends to be a very specific history to B’s behaviour. In their childhoods, they were made to feel ashamed of their needs. They had to be a strong little boy or girl and all the praise came in relation to their independence and lack of what was called ‘weakness.’ The lesson of the past is that their needs are repulsive and must be excised at all costs.\n\nDouble Self-Portrait, Egon Schiele, 1915, Wikimedia Commons.\n\nNevertheless, the desire to love and be loved hasn’t gone away. It’s just so dangerous that it has to be experienced by proxy. B gives A the responsibility of expressing a level of emotional hunger that is theirs in part but that they can’t permit themselves to experience consciously. A will have to crave and long so that B can continue to think they don’t need anything as babyish and silly as love.\nThis bargain is no fun for A. They might &#8211; in a different relationship &#8211; have been rather calm and composed, adult and cheerful. But there is no chance of any such respite in this set up. Here they are constantly having to doubt themselves and their sanity: why are they so demanding? Why do they look at their phone so many times waiting for a text? Why do they find themselves pleading and begging like a small child that their partner spend more time with them? Why are they so pathetic (as the partner hints they are)? What’s happened to their adult dignity?&nbsp;\nMeanwhile, B can stand back and complain of feeling trapped and hounded, not given enough freedom and held too tightly in mind. They can wonder in an off hand way: ‘Goodness me, why are they making such a fuss! They are so intense, it’s revolting!’ Which is a version of what someone would have made them feel when they were very little.\nThis can’t go on indefinitely. At some point, person B has to stop hitching a free ride on A’s emotional coattails. At some point they have to own up to some of their own childlike dependence. At some point, they need to come to a realisation they have been in flight from since their early days: ‘I am a needy person too, as every human is, entirely legitimately. There is nothing pathetic at all about craving love; the only weakness is to keep wanting so badly to be ‘strong.’’\nB has to confront their terror that they will tell A that they crave them and then A will run away and mock and disdain them. And they have to see that, blessedly, this is just a terror, not a fact, one that owes its origins to the particular circumstances of Bs childhood, not to the nature of adult reality.\nThe beautiful truth is that the moment that B can learn to say ‘I need you’ will also be the moment when A can finally start to relax and be at peace in the relationship (and incidentally, love B more deeply). No one will have to abandon anyone; fear can lessen on both sides. Vulnerability is so much less of a burden when, finally, two people can be brave enough to own up to their share of it.",

      "text": "There are distinct challenges around trying to offer love to someone who isn’t convinced that they are, deep down, worthy of such a thing.\nImagine a relationship between Sarah and Dan. It began three months ago and things are flourishing: two weekends ago, they went on a romantic break to Paris, last weekend, she took him to meet her parents, and this weekend, they are going to see a group of his friends in the city he went to university in. All the signs are that they like each other very much and that the relationship may flourish.\nBut let’s also imagine that when Dan was a little boy, his mother was offhand and uninterested in him, preferring to devote herself to his older sister. Though this was many years ago, and Dan is now accomplished in his profession and his life more broadly, he carries just below the surface a wound with the power to cause substantial difficulties in any love story in the here and now.\nIt’s when Sarah starts to offer him intense affection that the problems start. It’s not that her love is undesired. It’s just that it is &#8211; at an unconscious level &#8211; deeply difficult to accept. In order to protect himself from hurt, young Dan had to build his character to withstand isolation and endure loneliness and a meagre emotional diet. He had to make his peace with deprivation and to doubt the sincerity of anyone who would wish to treat him well (not coincidentally, he might previously have gone out with a number of women who were unavailable or offhand. It was horrible, but it felt like home).\nWe might suppose that accepting a gift that has once been denied will be especially easy &#8211; but this isn’t the way our minds work. At the arrival of exactly what they have always wanted, those who are deprived tend to become extremely fussy and difficult, sceptical and argumentative. They cause a scene. They ruin the atmosphere. They try to bring down the temperature. They want to get away from what is experienced as, secretly, unbearable in its beauty, plenitude and hopefulness.\n\nPhoto: Klaus Nielsen, 2020, Pexels.\n\nSo over dinner, from the blue, Dan accuses Sarah of being sarcastic and disrespectful towards his tastes in books. She is puzzled, but Dan digs in. ‘You aren’t taking me seriously,’ he argues. ‘I do, I’m sorry if you’ve got that impression but it’s not anything I feel,’ Sarah counters with maturity. But Dan won’t be appeased. He crashes the entire evening. What had started so well ends in misery. The fancy Italian restaurant can’t rescue the mood, the couple go home in a sulk, Dan sleeps on the sofa and the plans for the next day are cancelled. All for apparently ‘nothing’ or rather for something both entirely lamentable and psychologically compelling: Dan’s need to ensure that love cannot threaten his defensive isolation.\nDan is in effect crying out: ‘You can’t really love me’, not because his partner doesn’t, but because his mother didn’t. The scepticism, created by one person, is deposited decades later on the unwitting head of another. He is also implicitly saying: ‘You don’t love me enough &#8211; or at least not in the right way.’ There is in this a fatefully demanding note. Dan can’t seem to accept that Sarah is merely good enough, rather than perfect &#8211; as no human can be. He uses her ordinary characteristics as a weapon against her.\nIf we think of it in terms of food, someone who was left to be very hungry may be especially tricky once a meal is offered to them. They may become excessively idealistic rather than realistic about what is good enough. Deprived people become more extreme in their fantasy of what they need to keep them alive: they picture the perfect meal, their fantasy has so much more work to do to tide them over.\nDan should learn to understand that he is picking a fight because of a terror around trusting in something that might yet turn out to be false. He would rather crash the relationship himself than be surprised &#8211; yet again &#8211; by the treachery of another person. Dan and Sarah won’t be able to make it without the fundamental insight of modern psychotherapy: that the way we love now has to pass through the gate of the way we loved then. And that if there were distortions originally there will be distortions in the present. It seems we have no option but to understand our histories to liberate ourselves from their sad strictures.",

      "text": "It’s understandably daunting to be invited to rely on a machine to do something that, throughout our lives, we’d believed we needed to take care of by ourselves. The first people to step aboard a plane or talk on the telephone must have felt a similar kind of vertigo. Yet there are now immense opportunities to improve our relationships through the use of Artificial Intelligence. Here are the main ways we suggest that you set yourself up with an AI couples therapist:\n1. Pick the right AI\nThere are many AI platforms on offer. For relationships, we are drawn to https://claude.ai/ which seems especially thoughtful, kind and perspicacious. Better ones may well emerge in time; this feels like the leader for now.\n\nPexels, 2023\n\n2. Allow it to know you and your partner\nOpen a chat thread which you then return to repeatedly. Give it a title: ‘My AI Relationship Therapist.’ The more you revisit this thread, the more the machine will know you; and the cleverer and more on point it can be in its advice.\nStart by giving the AI the following prompt: ‘I want you to function as my AI couples therapist. In your answers and suggestions, please draw on the long tradition of psychodynamic psychotherapy. Make particular use of attachment theory where necessary.’&nbsp;\nNext give the AI as much background as possible on you and your partner.&nbsp;\nTell it about your respective childhoods and patterns of attachment:\n&#8211; My relationship with my mother was…\n&#8211; My relationship with my father was…\n&#8211; My mother made me feel…\n&#8211; My father made me feel…\nAllow it insight into your neurotic or fragile or awkward characteristics:\n&#8211; I worry inordinately that…\n&#8211; I can’t cope so well with…\n&#8211; What can make me difficult to be around…\n&#8211; I might be gently teased for being…\nTurn to your experience of previous adult relationships:\n&#8211; In my first relationship, I…\n&#8211; Typically in love I…\n&#8211; I crave…\n&#8211; What has tended to go wrong is…\nNow turn to your present relationship:\n&#8211; What I love about my partner…\n&#8211; What is tricky with my partner…\n&#8211; The main flashpoints are…\n&#8211; In a recent argument…\n&#8211; My attachment style is…\n&#8211; My partner’s attachment style is…\n3. Allow AI to come to your assistance in Crises\nOnce the AI is sufficiently well programmed, its particular skill lies in its ability to give balanced, sane, kind advice at moments of crisis. When our neocortex has gone offline, when it’s very late or the mood has become hugely stressful, it will still be there as a beacon of reason, ready for us to lean on.\n\nPexels, 2023\n\nDownload a version of the platform on your phone and, when there is a dispiriting argument or mood brewing over dinner, pause discussion with your partner, pull out your phone and immediately tell AI the following (it has voice activation):\n&#8211; My partner has said that…\n&#8211; I’ve responded by saying that…\n&#8211; They are feeling…\n&#8211; I am feeling…\n&#8211; What should we do in the next 30 minutes to bring down the temperature?\n&#8211; What might we do tomorrow morning?\n&#8211; What is it we are forgetting?\n&#8211; What are three things we might both try to keep in mind right now?\nMake a habit of turning to AI during all kinds of moments of tension. For example:\n&#8211; During a sulk: ask it to write your partner an ideal message to change the dynamic.\n&#8211; If you are feeling resentful around your partner: ask AI to write a message outlining the sources of your upset (or helping you to diagnose what these might be).\n&#8211; Complete the sentence: What I need my partner to understand is… Then ask AI to turn your answer into a message that the partner stands the highest chance of sympathising with.\nAt points, allow it into the largest dilemmas of all:\n&#8211; Should we be together?\n&#8211; Given the tensions between us, should we be thinking of committing? What are the upsides and the downsides?\n&#8211; Given what you know of my attachment style, what should I bear in mind in relation to this person?\nSince the dawn of time, we’ve been more or less alone with our relationships. At best, we’ve been able to share our sorrows with a parent, therapist or friend hours or days after an event. Now we have the chance to allow an ideal gentle authority figure to listen to our emotional histories and then, with our traumas and fault-lines in mind, to provide calming thoughts based on the long history of psychotherapy at especially difficult moments. This doesn’t replace books, personal insights or real therapy, indeed the more we know of ourselves, the more AI can accurately guide us to our wishes. For too long, we have thought of love as an emotion, it is in fact a skill &#8211; and there is no reason why, as with so many other tools, we wouldn’t allow one of our AI machines to lend us a hand with one of the great challenges of our lives.",

We know the reality is a little more complicated but &#8211; for much of our lives &#8211; we’re able to keep matters more or less under wraps. There may have been a few extreme moments on our own in the bedroom or bathroom or driving in the car or coming home late on a train, but generally we’ll have drawn tight boundaries around the crises and no one will have known.\nBut then &#8211; if we are unlucky and probably if we are just human &#8211; life will test us more than this. At some stage, we’ll end up in a situation that blows apart our normal abilities to cope, which destroys our capacity for perspective, for reason, for calm and for mastery. It might be something at work or in our relationships, a financial or a health issue, something to do with reputation or with family responsibility. As the problem continues to grow, we will realise that we are in uncharted waters, that we are entirely overwhelmed &#8211; and that we don’t know whom to turn to. Sadly it isn’t uncommon that our thoughts may eventually grow very dark indeed. In our private agony, we may start to imagine that it really would be better if we didn’t exist and that there might be only one way to stop the pain.\nIf we are to survive (and there truly may be nothing less at stake), we are going to need to be very brave indeed. We’re going to need to break the isolated habits of a lifetime &#8211; and take someone into our confidence. Every impulse may tell us to manage things alone; we are trained to fear confession; we are experts in not revealing our vulnerabilities.\nAt the same time, we don’t have a choice any longer. We might not make it if we do not speak. And so, we may simply have to write a message or letter a bit like this to someone close to us whom we hoped never to have to depend on to this extent:\n\nPhoto: Wallace Chuck, 2019.\n\nI’m so sorry to bother you with this. Something a bit difficult has come up. Please forgive me for taking up your time. I thought I could cope but I can’t. I’m feeling overwhelmed and didn’t know whom to turn to.\nThe reality is that we may not have an ideal friend in the vicinity. Perhaps the person we have picked is a little gauche or easily scared or busy. But we can’t wait for perfection to arrive. We need another mind to help us where our own has faltered.\nI wonder if I might drop in on you. After work. Or perhaps we can have a call one evening.\nWe may in any case be underestimating what they can deal with. We may have colluded with them to keep matters fun and superficial over the years but they, like we, will have their complexities and may be a lot more adept at navigating the messiness of life than we imagine. We may be very surprised by what others can deal with when we need them.\nI hope this isn’t too surprising. I’m sure I can get through this, but right now I’m a bit at sea.\nThe price of survival is a drop in pride. They’ll have to see us crying, they’ll have to know we’ve done a foolish or embarrassing thing, we’ll have to show that we’re not as mentally coherent as we wanted to be, we’ll need to admit to our confusion, sorrow and guilt. It’s hugely awkward and absolutely not our first choice, but if we act, we’ll have a chance to reach our eighties and maybe see some grandchildren.\nI wish I didn’t have to bother you.\nWe underestimate how much we all love to be needed; how much we long to be able to help others as a way to make ourselves feel less useless and alone. We may almost be doing someone else a favour; rescuing them from a sense of isolation.\nI can explain properly when I see you.\nThere will probably be tears when we eventually narrate our story. We’ll think we are ‘pathetic’ but any kind onlooker will simply take us to be touching and brave. With any luck, the friend will know more or less what to say, the confession will help hugely, some perspective will be found &#8211; and the friendship will become deeper than any we have yet had.\nWe’ll eventually be able to look back on this nightmarish period with a shudder but also immense gratitude. We’ll have learnt a lesson in not keeping it all to ourselves and, almost without knowing it, we’ll start to emit suggestions to others that we would be someone to talk to during the worst days of their lives.",

These are not the real questions to ask at a party, not when we ache with so much inside, not when we yearn to find an echo of our sorrows and longings in others. But it can seem impossible not to end up here. A species that knows how to train geophysicists and neurosurgeons, that builds institutions to teach biology and algebra, Finnish and Mediaeval history, that writes operating manuals for submarines and food processors blithely neglects any role for education, explanation or ritual around the art of conversation.\n\nPhoto: Woman and Man Standing Near Wall -Inga Seliverstova, 2019 (Pexels)\n\nLet&#8217;s therefore imagine an ideal evening, on the edge of a weekend, in a comfortable setting, with a genial host and a handful of guests around a table. Each person would be invited to draw from a deck of cards in the centre &#8211; and answer the question printed on it with unusual sincerity. These are the topics we might, if we could only surrender our fears, love to speak and hear more about:\n&#8211; In what ways are you a bit unreasonable?\n&#8211; What do you hope you could be forgiven for?\n&#8211; If you could change something about your childhood, what would it be?\n&#8211; How can you be tricky in relationships?\n&#8211; What’s an anxiety that other people might not necessarily expect you to have?\n&#8211; What do you dislike about yourself?\n&#8211; What are your weaknesses around work?\n&#8211; What parts of your personality might be defences against early pain?\n&#8211; What do you wish you could ask for more directly in love?\n&#8211; What’s most admirable about you?\n&#8211; What do you wish you could change about yourself?\n&#8211; How have you upset people without meaning to?\n&#8211; What failings of character might you normally be a bit reluctant to admit to others?\n&#8211; What are you afraid others may assume about you?\nWe may ultimately face a choice: between dignity on the one hand, loneliness on the other. What we have to lose in terms of impressiveness, we may gain in terms of humanity. If we answer the right questions — especially the sorts of real, revealing questions to ask at a party — we will no longer seem like the impregnable, confident, knowledgeable people we normally strive to be. We’ll have mentioned the break-up, the anxiety that never leaves us alone, the sense of ineptness that pursues us in professional life. We may have hesitated while our eyes filled with tears. But we’ll emerge as something even more impressive than impregnable: people strong enough to share their wounds, serious enough to laugh at themselves, sane enough to be weird and so ready — at last — for true friendship.",

      "text": "We typically assume that the ultimate aim of all our efforts is to have a happy life. And judged on this basis, many of us have to admit – in the silence of our minds – that we are not really doing very well. There is so much that – every year, and perhaps almost every day – comes along to spoil our ambitions: there is a power struggle at the office, there’s a problem in our families, our friends feel superficial or disengaged, our anxieties don’t abate and our relationships are scratchy or distant. Our difficulties generate a basic layer of misery, but a secondary layer is then swiftly added to it – caused by an underlying sense that our unhappiness represents a fundamental violation of life’s true purpose. Not only are we unhappy, we are unhappy that we are unhappy – in the light of our tightly-held belief in the possibility of a state of enduring satisfaction. We are both sad and crushed that we have failed at the single-most important goal open to all sane and ambitious humans.\nIt is in such moments of knotted misery that we may gain some relief from reframing our situation. While we may not be able to overcome our burdens themselves, it does lie in our power to alter what these burdens have to mean to us. We may not have to take them as proof of our stupidity or ill-adjustment, they can be signs that we are destined to have interesting lives rather than calm ones, lives marked by a high degree of exploration, psychological understanding, and striving rather than settled certainty and equilibrium. What we lack in terms of contentment, we may make up for in terms of insight and experience.\n\nRichard Carline, Mount Hermon and Mount Sannin above the Clouds, c. 1920\n\nWe, the often troubled ones, the typically anxious ones, the ones who frequently reach the end of a day as exhausted and shaken as if we had crossed mountains, might judge our complicated situations with a new rueful kind of pride. We belong to a distinctive and in its way estimable cohort. We are always going to find a cloud on our horizons, we’ll never spend more than half an hour before being visited by some kind of distemper, we are never going to accept things as they are or make totally wise choices around love or work. But this doesn’t perhaps have to be the measure of everything. We don’t need to be constantly offended by our agitations. Our day to day troubles don’t have to be the yardstick by which we judge the value of our lives. Given where we have come from and how we are constituted, we were never going to be ‘happy’ in any obvious way.&nbsp;\nBut perhaps a good life can in the end be compatible with being fairly perturbed most days of the week. Perhaps it doesn’t matter that a relationship has failed once more. Perhaps it isn’t appalling that our business doesn’t deliver us the returns we might have had in our old job. We have stretched ourselves, we have learnt to raise our voices, we have developed courage. We don’t have to see marks of grief and trouble as some kind of a violation of a pristine contract but as the logical and immovable consequences of our stubborn and subtle natures interacting with the complexities of existence.&nbsp;\nWe are sometimes frightened into reorienting our lives by being asked to contemplate how we might feel about them from the vantage point of our death beds. But if on this bed, we were to look back at a roller coaster of emotions and events (we might have got married for the fifth time recently), we might smile to ourselves and – to the beeping of the heart monitor beside us – say, with wisdom and compassion, it wasn’t a calm life for sure, it wasn’t for the most part even a happy one but heaven knows it was a truly and properly interesting one. And with this as our measure, we might meet our end with all the satisfaction and self-acceptance we could hope for.",

      "text": "On the Caribbean islands of Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago, there’s a skill which is widely revered, which has been granted a word of its own, and which the rest of the world is still waiting to properly understand or honour: liming.\nTo lime (the concept comes as a verb or a noun) means to pause one’s regular activities, often for several hours, typically in the evening, in order to gather with people, usually near strangers, probably outside – in order to talk, listen and (at points) silently contemplate the surrounding natural or human scene. It might sound obvious described in this way, but done properly, with intelligence and intent, liming is in fact a rare art. To know how to lime isn’t just one more low-key leisure activity, it’s evidence that one has understood some extremely significant things about oneself and one’s place in society and the cosmos.\n\nSunset in Barbados. Photo by Chloe Christine on Unsplash\n\nWe can take away six lessons from the Antillean practice of liming.\n1. Companionship as Therapy\nWe know it in theory: other people are good for us. And yet we seem to have mostly determinedly built a world that atomises us, where it is close to impossible to talk to strangers, where the protocols in public spaces militate against any kind of spontaneous interaction, where we are brought together only to shop or make money and must otherwise hide in narrow hutches that have to be paid for through a lifetime of striving.\nAs a result, we overinvest in Romantic love, placing unfair demands on one person rather than leaning more realistically on the support of a multitude. We ruminate on problems that become ever larger the more we keep them enclosed in our airless minds. We imagine what ‘other people’ might think without ever testing our premises. And we become obsessed with individual achievement as the only apparent route to being witnessed and treated with warmth.\nA liming culture lifts a host of these burdens from us. Without needing elaborate introductions, without prior notice, we are allowed into a group, in a cafe, on a street corner or in the park. To start a conversation isn’t a risky intrusion on standard etiquette. It’s the done thing; it’s what’s expected.\nSurrounded by new faces, it suddenly no longer matters quite what we imagined alone in our room only minutes before. Perhaps the problems can be overcome. Maybe we’ve been getting a lot of things wrong. We may have lost perspective. Not knowing what others were thinking, we may have filled in the blanks in unfortunate ways. Even when our companions are not discussing our worries exactly, in the course of airing their particular concerns, they relativise our own. We can derive a sense that we’re all beautifully flawed creatures muddling along, doing our best, looking up at the stars and routinely falling into ditches. We’re not uniquely cursed. We’re loveable fools – as attested by the bursts of laughter that greet many of the anecdotes told by limers across Bridgetown and Port of Spain.\n2. It’s Not About Romance\nWe typically cling to the notion that being part of a couple is the only way to be known, to be seen and to be treated with kindness. Liming culture upsets these daunting assumptions. It understands that Romantic relationships are tricky, that we’re all difficult from close up and that the worst sides of us tend to come out where we have our highest expectations.\nWhen with a group of fellow limers, we are kind enough not to want too much, these people don’t have to grasp every aspect of our soul, it won’t be a tragedy if they don’t understand all the details of our day or agree with us on every point.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWe’re not trying to make a life together and, with more circumscribed aims, we come closer to understanding what love can be in its higher, less egoistic, more compassionate and accepting dimensions.\n3. Presence is More Important Than Content\nThese are not the conversations of Socrates. The value of liming isn’t premised on the discovery of any specific set of truths.\nLiming discussions drift here and there with seeming randomness; that is their point and their focus.&nbsp;\nWe aren’t going anywhere fast, but something important is happening nevertheless. We’re being allowed into others’ streams of consciousness. We’re finding out the true contents of others’ minds, in their variety and oddity. We’re daring to share with one another what it’s like to be human.\n4. Silence is Fine\nNo one will mind if we sit out a topic for a while or if the whole group falls quiet. As is implicitly understood: we can only get into a position to disclose the really important things when we overcome our fear of silence.\n5. There Are Alternatives to The Status Race\nWe too often assume that what we are fundamentally after are status and money (and fight accordingly), but the insight of liming is that it may be sweetness and companionship that we truly seek.\nAmong other limers, it no longer really matters who might be CEO and who a street vendor. What counts is our openness of spirit, our degree of candour and our readiness to see the absurdity of things.\nIt isn’t that we won’t – as limers – in any way strive to get promoted. It’s just that, already on a modest salary, we’ll be the recipients of the kind of emotional reassurance and fellowship that  might otherwise power a hunger for a fortune.\n6. Busy-ness and Laziness Are Closer Than We Think\nIt looks as if we might just be being lazy. But the limer has a different take on the notion of effort. From the liming perspective, there’s a distinct laziness in being always so ‘busy’ that one forgets one’s dependence on others. There’s laziness in sternly insisting that one’s individual efforts should count for so much and in basing one’s esteem on narrow professional pride. There’s laziness in not registering someone’s new haircut or the stars or the fresh coat of paint on Mrs X’s house. There’s laziness in neglecting the details of life which, if a novelist put them in a book, one would remember to praise and love.\nThe concept of liming gives us the courage to take seriously what we may have wanted all along but been too hesitant or confused to formulate and ask for. We should consider ourselves extremely fortunate to learn the art of liming – and to have a chance to fall in with a group of fellow limers before too long.",

      "text": "In one of the upper rooms of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford hangs a picture by a minor Danish nineteenth century artist, Claus Anton Kølle. Measuring around the size of a sheet of A4, the picture shows us a courtyard in Rome with a yellow wall, a conservatory roof, various kinds of trees and most significantly, at the centre of dense foliage, a handful of oranges.\n\nClaus Anton Kølle, A Courtyard in Rome, 1860\n\nWe can sometimes wonder what art is for. It has enormous prestige in our societies and yet there is considerable ongoing mystery as to its fundamental purpose. Why do governments give money to museums? Why do we send school children on improving trips to galleries? Why all the respect and reverence for pictures in a world with ostensibly graver priorities?\nKølle’s picture offers us one possible answer: art is there to refocus our attention on what matters most deeply. Traditionally, that would have meant drawing our minds back to the Virgin Mary or the Buddha, the King or a minister of state. But Kølle has a different target in mind: importance for him lies in some citrus fruits quietly growing in a sheltered spot in a busy city. These are his sacraments and his divinities.\nYet the oranges are not – of course – just oranges. Kølle’s painting is a sermon about not giving up, about hope, about the pleasures that still remain open to us even in dark circumstances, about our capacity for joy despite many kinds of suffering. The oranges are whatever remains nourishing and pleasurable. They are the project we’re looking forward to starting, they’re our very good friend we can call up at moments of crisis, the lover we have a playful nickname for, the five year old nephew we are taking out to the zoo next week, the book that comforts us. \nKølle isn’t denying that there might be darker forces around. He knew all about wars, tyranny, poverty and discord (his own life was notably difficult). But it’s precisely because the horrors of existence are no secret that the more innocent, joyful, and pretty elements matter so much. Those ‘oranges’ aren’t just nice (though they are that too); they are arguments against despair.\nKølle never gained the fame or respect he felt he was owed. As is the case for most of us, his life was not quite as he wished it to be. Nevertheless, his achievement remains notable. He made a quiet unobtrusive masterpiece on which we can hang a whole philosophy of art – and of redemption. For a moment or two, across the centuries, he beams us a message: don’t give up, keep searching for what can work out, stop being surprised by pain, look out – always, in the depths of the dark foliage – for the bright, sweet oranges.",

      "text": "We know so much about the importance of complaining; of standing up against problems; of pointing out what is wrong; of doing our part to fight for goodness and justice.&nbsp;\nYet it’s because we know this lesson so well that it can – at particular moments – pay to let into our minds another far more peculiar and provocative thought, not to replace it but to sit alongside it: the importance of – sometimes – moving silently away from disappointment, letdown, irritation and evil; of falling quiet; of not-complaining. \n\nEduard Ole, Travellers, 1929 \n\nWe may choose not to complain not because we are weak, or wilful or indifferent or cowed or callous, but for a more fundamental and clear-eyed reason: because we are up against something we know we cannot change; because we have enough experience of power and victory to recognise powerlessness and constraint; because we appreciate that to complain about something that isn’t going to change carries as much of a cost as not to complain about something that can.\nThrough futile pleading, we let go of what remains of our power and further surrender our dignity to an undeserving foe. We pay what is awful too much respect to dwell on it continuously yet in vain. For while we complain, there is so much that we are prevented from doing: innovating, thinking, building, nurturing. Our enemy may have captured our outward circumstances, we should refuse on top of everything else to give them our time and our composure. In the frank acknowledgement of our powerlessness lies a last assertion of our power.&nbsp;\nThat is why – when we can do nothing about an antagonist, a tyrant, a rumour, a delay, a disease – we may with dignity turn our minds elsewhere. It isn’t that we don’t care. We just refuse to allow the insuperable problem to take up more of our imagination and opt instead to focus on what can still be improved and enjoyed. \nThis is a philosophy of pessimism rather than of resignation. The pessimist attempts to liberate themselves from futile outrage and reclaim freedom amidst upset by swiftly pricing in what is irredeemable. The pessimist refuses to give the negative the power to overtake them. Their bodies may be in agony, governments perfidious, folly triumphant. They will not be entirely subsumed, they will not allow awfulness a final victory.\nWe can consider the two great selective non-complainers of the Western tradition, Socrates and Jesus. They tried – as few others have before or since – to replace vindictiveness and irrationality with kindness and thought. But when unbudgeable disaster came, they didn’t challenge. ‘Complain to the government of Athens,’ Socrates’s friends urged him when his death sentence was delivered. ‘No,’ he replied, ‘let’s do a little more philosophy in the hours that remain.’ ‘Complain to the Roman authorities,’ Jesus’s friends urged him. But the time for that was gone: ‘they know not what they do.’\nWe shouldn’t give our enemies the privilege of consuming our minds. We can fight them with intensity and then – when we can do no more – should turn elsewhere, not in order to escape our duties but so as better to mine what remains of our capacities for hope and love.",

      "text": "There are moods – of dissatisfaction and loneliness, panic and despair – when the very best counsel we might be offered is to go and take a ride on the underground, probably in mid-afternoon, on one of the less travelled lines, not in order to go anywhere in particular in the outer world but to try to reach certain new and kinder places in the inner one. \n\n\n\nHow could we have predicted, twenty minutes ago, that we would be on this particular brightly lit rumbling stage with this specific set of actors seated so close that we can hear them swallow. We pretend not to look but how avidly we are – of course – studying everything. There are new combinations at every stop: a veterinary nurse next to a goth, an airline pilot next to an imam, a five year old child next to an octogenarian. The broad message is clear: the world is various, reality is unforeseen, everything is so deeply peculiar. Here no one cares who might have said what to whom in our relationship, no one has any interest in our professional frustrations or the tensions with our parents or children. Our self-absorbed panics that mattered so much in the world above are as nothing in the pitch black tunnels lit up with reflections for adverts boasting of solutions to baldness, insomnia and the menopause. We are a blessedly anonymous and indistinct monad in a rattling kaleidoscope. We can find peace not by striving for certainty or ever more significance but by coming to terms with our beautifully negligible place in a boundlessly restless and mysterious urban universe.\nIn the silence, we can contemplate our fellow humans with new sympathy. A dentist from Hendon might spend the period between Bond Street and Green Park sitting next to a lathe operator from Ohio – to whom he might have had so much to say. A pair of new lovers – still astonished that they have found one another – sit directly across from someone going through a protracted divorce. An elderly individual, heading to a consultation tracking the state of a worrying tumour, was once a teenager; and their neighbour, pressed so close, and on their way to art school, will one day be old: their unique existences separated only by an inch of stale air and a few layers of cloth. A child seems to be delightedly counting the stops and perhaps imagining that the train is flying through space. We’ll never know exactly what is going through anyone’s mind but – for a moment – we’re struck by one of the greatest of all thoughts: that the inward reality of an absolute stranger is just as vivid and complex and hard to describe as our own. \nThere’s an outflow of good will. We know the rules but we’d love to smile and say something benign; to wish our fellow travellers well. They’ll never know that for a short but important time, as we rattled thirty metres below a department store or electricity substation, they were the object of our expansive tenderness. And, with even greater poignancy, we ourselves will never know what kindness was wished upon us by certain of our companions. If we let ourselves, our hearts might burst open with compassion for the human condition: for the unbearable intertwining of tragedy and joy, despair and hope. In The Divine Comedy, Dante imagined a journey below the earth’s surface as a tour of hell. Technology and good manners have transformed a realm of fear into a place of silent communion and redemption.&nbsp;\nAlong the way, our journey provides unusually good opportunities for thinking. We rarely think well when we’re simply left to our own devices in a study with silence and a blank of sheet of paper. But something about the constant motion and the entrances and exits helps to distract the nervous, censorious parts of our minds that quashes all our originality, giving more wayward and creative thoughts a chance to break through. With our eyes half closed, between stations, opposite two Ghanaians carrying implausibly large rucksacks, we properly rethink our options in a relationship or what we might do next with the project in Spain. While covertly studying an old lady cleaning her glasses, we finally imagine a way to get a colleague on side.&nbsp;\nWe’re not meant to be pleased to be down here, of course. When people first travelled on underground trains, in the early 1860s, the miracle was obvious and some would wave their hats in gratitude to the planners, engineers and workers who had made it possible. Today we forget about awe and even a modest hurrah would seem like a sign of insanity. To think we might reserve the term ‘luxury travel’ only to those going about in tiny metal boxes constantly stopped in the traffic above when this leviathan pulls four hundred people from 0 to 30mph in 10 seconds and never hits a junction. We overlook that, thanks to the minute contributions of millions of travellers, the city has been able to afford to create an express train that blithely passes under a river, a detail that would certainly detain a Martian or a five year old child. It can be easy to give up on humanity; but a bit less so after one has properly taken in the majesty and prowess of a carriage by Metro-Cammel or Bombardier, all the more impressive for being owned not by some jealous and secretive tycoon, but by every citizen who has ever bought a ticket.\nOne of noblest ambitions of culture – of the visual arts and poetry – has always been to reawaken our slumbering appreciation of wonders to which familiarity has closed our hearts. But we are in error if we suppose that the places we need to go in order to wake to the majesty of existence is the library or the gallery. There’s an innocent, but fatal, snobbery that suggests that great experiences happen only in rare and elevated places; that we will find the meaning of life in a fragile manuscript or in a canvas so precious it must be protected by bullet proof glass.\nAnd yet what the great writers and artists have always been frantically signalling is that we should open our eyes to what is all around us already. We might, for greater and deeper impact, head to the nearest underground station and take a short, but potentially life transforming, trip from Swiss Cottage to Canada Water.",

      "text": "We can spend a lot of our lives angrily focused on just how hopeless and awful many things are: this report someone has sent us, the way our partner is with us, the hotel room we’ve just checked in to, the way a friend is being… But at some point, it may transform our sense of reality to let in a hugely challenging but in the end possibly highly redemptive thought: ‘What if the problem were first and foremost not with the world, but with me? What if I wasn’t overwhelmingly surrounded by idiots and fools, threats and insults, dangers and disappointments but was instead – above anything else – simply and poignantly a very miserable person?’\n\nLouis-Jean-François Lagrenée, Melancholy, 18th Century\n\nIt isn’t – naturally – entirely pleasant to have to redraw our self-image in this way but once we do so, we stand to come to a much clearer picture of what is actually in front of us, we can direct an appropriate amount of care and compassion at our wounded, suspicious and fearful selves and we can aim eventually to improve the quality of our judgements and interactions with others. \nImagine that we have started to have doubts about our partner. We worry about a silly thing they said at dinner, we feel that we don’t have much fun together any more, we wonder whether there might be better people out there, we get irritated by the way they clear their throat or close the fridge… But before we call time on (yet another) union, we might pause to ask ourselves a deceptively simple question that may help us to sort out the accuracy of our feelings in this as in other contexts: ‘How often do I feel comfortable around anyone?’\nIn other words: ‘How unusual is this particular feeling of being dissatisfied, irritated and restless? Is it limited to this partner or has this shown up with other partners too?’ The way to improve our judgement is to explore how common a way of passing a verdict is for us; and we can say, the more common it is, the more we should cautiously explore how appropriate it might be in a specific setting. Before giving up on someone, we should ask ourselves: ‘How satisfied am I ever with anyone I’ve ever yet happened to meet? And indeed, with anything I’ve ever yet come across? How normal is it for me to be happy not just with a person, but – let’s say – with a hotel, a new watch, a book? Are there any similarities between how I am feeling about my partner – and the complaints I am prone to direct at countless other situations in my life?’ \nWe might as a result pick up on an overall melancholy and querulousness inside us that is likely to operate across the board, that finds fault in almost all contexts – and that could, once we spot it, lead us to have second and more forgiving thoughts about our current partner’s apparently unmasterable flaws of character. A person who properly knows that they are seldom happy with anyone has the option to look with greater benevolence at a relationship in which things feel (once more) less than perfect.\nOr if we wake up panicking in the early hours after a decision we’ve taken, rather than simply listening to our fears reverentially, we might ask: ‘How often do feel this way? How often do I panic about other things in a relatively similar manner? And how often have my intense feelings turned out to be accurate guides to reality? Is there something specific to worry about here or is my mind perhaps intent on engaging on a very habitual manoeuvre: grabbing on to something to alarm itself with?’ We can wonder kindly whether our perturbance might be stemming more from something long-standing in us than from anything especially threatening in our outer circumstances.\nOr imagine that we are feeling extremely frustrated with a colleague and have become convinced that they will never be able to help us. But to look more benignly at our irritating fellow employee, we might take a moment to wonder: ‘How often do I assume that no one can help me? How often do I feel that everyone else is a fool? And when I do so, how much do I ever in fact try to explain myself before giving way to a resentful sense of isolation? Am I actually so isolated or do I simply quickly feel so very fast?’\nOr late at night, we might grow certain that our life is in a dreadful state. One option is to double down on the exploration of apparent catastrophe. Another is to wonder: ‘How often do things feel very gloomy after 9pm?’\nBy exploring the frequency with which a given emotion crops up, we stand to become more aware of historically-created biases that are open to nuance:\n— X seems to hate me; but how often do I think people are not on my side?\n— It seems Y is doing it on purpose: but how often do I assume that harm might be deliberate?\n— I fear I’m going to get into great trouble with Z: but how often do I worry that I’m going to be badly  punished?\n— I feel guilty about something that I’ve done: but how often am I tormented by a sense of sinfulness?\nThrough interrogations into the generality and frequency of a given emotion, we can take some of the pressure off a present verdict. We can discover that there may be something smeared on the lens through which we look out at the world and which distorts much of what we are seeing – and may have more to do with a mindset built up as a result of certain relatively uncommon and painful events in our formative years than with anything before us now. We keep re-seeing what once was – even where it may now not exist. We keep having to believe that people are unkind or that a terrible threat awaits us, because this was once what we faced. The beginning of better, more hopeful judgement begins with squaring up to how oddly prone to misjudgment we are – on the basis of how sad, fearful and yet also mercifully unrepresentative our early experiences may have been. By addressing the misery in us, we can discover a far more benevolent reality out there. Hope can spring from an initially hugely difficult thought: we don’t live in an unbearably miserable world, we may just have grown up (for extremely forgivable reasons) to be very miserable people.",

These things matter more rather than less even as our experience of the outer world and its people and places keeps increasing.\n\nGustave Van de Woestyne, The Porridge Eater, 1911\n\nThings tend to begin very differently; with relentless appetites for scale and outward excitement. We want to bestride the world, leave a mark and meet soulmates. We get bored in minutes in the most majestic settings. We take the greatest mysteries in our stride. We seldom stop by the side of the road to think or look.&nbsp;\nBut at some point, the direction of ambition reverses – and what tends to initiate the change is pain. The more challenging existence as a whole becomes, the more we get to know about love, sickness, infighting, intransigence, career reversal and political turmoil, the more we may appreciate what remains pure and hopeful, despite its modest appearance or lack of obvious glamour. Our respect for a fig, a moment of calm and a kind but unexciting friend is underpinned by memories of nights of crying, months lost to argument and instances of untrammelled despair in the bathroom in the darkness.\nIt is difficulty that catalyses our interest in and respect for gardening or a painting of a lake in autumn, the lifecycles of ducks or an article on the moons of Jupiter. It’s people who have known far more than they ever wanted about dementia, cancer, employment law, divorce and mental institutions, who are the great appreciators of blossom, empty days, train journeys and the moon above the house on warm evenings.\nTo a five year old, it’s just another ice cream and another sunny day. To the grandparent sitting with them, everything is close to supernatural: the tiny fingers, the small plump body, their child who is now a parent loading up the car, the sound of a House Finch somewhere in a tree. The child – if they are fortunate – has no sense of the fragility of everything and of the cruelty waiting in the wings. Who can know the pleasures of a boring day until there’s been a crowd at the door; who can delight in an uncomplicated chat until they’ve struggled to get something vital across to someone whom they eventually had to leave in order to save themselves; who can delight in another scoop of vanilla and melted chocolate until they have – at best – three summers left.\nThe simple wonders of the world are constantly being rediscovered; those at the vanguard of doing so are are those who have first had to walk the corridors of hell.",

      "text": "There is one sign that more than any other indicates that someone may well be a rewarding and trustworthy person to go out with: that they are prepared to go to therapy.\n\nRoger Fry, Vanessa Bell, c.1912\n\nWe should immediately be clear. Not all therapy is very successful and (dare we say it) not all therapists are very good.\nBut this is not the point. The issue isn’t so much that someone should have benefited from therapy in every possible way or even that they should actually have gone there &#8211; as that they should be prepared to accept that they might need therapy in the first place.\nThis matters so much because it indicates that at a fundamental level, a person has realised that they are are not entirely normal and are indeed, in a variety of ways, probably slightly unhinged and troublesome and these elements &#8211; far from posing a problem &#8211; are in fact what help to guarantee the sanity, peace, good humour and politeness of a relationship.&nbsp;\nA suitable partner isn’t someone entirely balanced and mature (there are none of those), it’s someone who no longer insists on their lucidity and stability and has come to terms with the limits of their self-understanding and their abilities to cope unaided. They have somewhere along the line recognised that life is far more complicated than they had envisaged and that it would be no affront to seek the help of someone else to make sense of the more uncomfortable parts of themselves. They have cast aside ideas of their own perfection &#8211; and therefore know how to laugh and to forgive.&nbsp;\nThe most calming and intelligent people aren’t ever too far from being able to accept that they might be fools, that it might well be their fault and that they might not know what on earth is going on. This kind of scepticism isn’t only funnier and more modest, it is of incalculable benefit when there is a storm between two people, when it’s late at night and one’s lost in the wrong part of town in a rental car, or when sex has become difficult or when there’s a fraught family meal on the horizon.\nThe great enemy of love is self-righteousness &#8211; and the willingness to go to therapy is in its way the most significant sign that one has outgrown it. The worthiest people do not always think that it has to be someone else’s fault, they are prepared to acknowledge that they are doing strange things, they know that they probably need to change &#8211; just as the enemies of good relationships are those who know that you’re invariably blame and that they are OK just as they are.&nbsp;\nThe willingness to go to therapy is therefore less about the specific benefits of therapy than about what happens when there’s a fight and someone can bear to break the deadlock by saying ‘maybe I need to go and think about that’ or ‘perhaps I’m bringing something complicated to the table too.’ And this, far more than expensive gifts and holidays, are the truly romantic ingredients of a relationship in the sense of the ingredients that can help love to flourish.\nMaybe our partner will go to therapy and be helped; or maybe they won’t. That matters far less than what their openness to the idea of therapy tells us: that this is someone who can stand to imagine that it might be their fault, that this is someone who knows they still have much to learn, in other words, that this is someone who may richly deserve our sympathy, tenderness and very precious time.",

For example, we imagine that to warrant two hours of our time, a conversation would need to focus on something like the future of our finances, the ultimate purpose of our careers or (perhaps) the nature of God.&nbsp;\nBut the best functioning couples know a rather different, more humble and more comedic truth. They know that the most serious upsets between people tend to have their origins in some very so-called ‘small places’. For instance, in the matter of how soon one should answer a text message, or who should touch whose hand first in the evening, or what should happen to an empty cup of tea.&nbsp;\n\nHarold Knight, In the Spring Time, c. 1908-9\n\nIt is here that high-minded, so-called intelligent partners are especially at risk, for they may operate with hugely unhelpful (and ultimately unserious) notions of what deserves to be counted as serious. Why would they, of all people, get mired in a scratchy squabble about crockery? Why would they devote hours to a petty issue around text messaging? Their respect skews towards the intellectual and the political, and away from the intimate and the domestic; their pride prevents them from countenancing that their lives might be undone by apparently minor matters. They are therefore prone to uttering two particularly risky sentences – ‘This isn’t worth talking about,’ and ‘Surely there are more important things to discuss than this’ – thereby forgetting that divorces can be pretty serious matters too and often begin with the very sort of teacup tensions to whose meaning they have refused to devote a conjugal seminar.\nIn reality, it isn’t ever just an empty cup of tea that we’re complaining about; it’s attitudes of thoughtlessness and neglect that have temporarily come to rest within a misplaced household object. Just as it isn’t simply a missing text that has perturbed us; it’s a low-key but significant hint as to how our dependent needs are being handled by our partner.&nbsp;\nIn certain areas, we accept readily enough that big themes can come to reside within small details. We don’t blame a painter for spending a couple of months adjusting the tone of the sky on their canvas. We don’t blame a musician for labouring for six months in order to perfect minute elements of a three minute pop song. Why then expect that love would require any less refinement and ‘work’? Why wouldn’t one spend two hours – even four or ten – over twenty seconds of dialogue or a towel in the wrong place?\nIn a better arranged world, couples would be advised to regularly go out for dinner to consider at length: A Very Small Thing That’s Happened Between Us That I Need to Talk To You About. They would be encouraged to dig out the most subtle-sounding matters in which one or other of them nevertheless felt that something consequential was entwined. Such laborious explorations of minutiae might not sound very Romantic; yet they would be so in the very truest sense of the term: namely, conducive and sustaining of love.\nOnce we enter a relationship, as truly grown up people understand, we have no option but to be as sensitive as very young children. We will fall into despair (and deep down want to burst into tears) because one ‘x’ was missing in an email – or a conversation ended without someone saying their customary ‘I love you’. We don’t need to compound our humiliation by insisting that it doesn’t exist. Imperturbability is not an option. The only way to prevent the largest problems is to focus exhaustively and with dark good humour on the very smallest ones.",

      "text": "There are some things we eventually become experts at gracefully admitting we’re not very good at. After an initial period of shame and furtiveness, we might come out and say that we’re in truth terrible at sport – and so be it. We’re never going to master tennis, we’re hopeless at swimming and we loathe jogging – but we conclude that life as a more or less dignified human being may be possible any way. A similar sanguine spirit might be present when we own up to being catastrophic at maths, or no good at business, or hopeless at culture. We might even – on a very brave day – get ahead of our meanest critics by admitting that we’re never going to win a modelling contract, our hair is thinning badly and we walk like a crab.\n\nWalter Vaes, Two Pomegranates, 1901\n\nBut one area stands out among the list of things we are generally not so ready to admit to failing at: love. Here, despite the greatest courage and good humour, we hold back. Our hopes are too intense, our pride too fragile. We cannot, truly cannot, bring ourselves to accept a fiasco in an area of such importance and so keep striving and holding out for eventual victory with sombre determination. There might have been two marriages already, and a complicated relationship since, but still we refuse to give up on our belief in our fundamental competence and ability to secure decent outcomes.\nUntil, one day, perhaps on a walk in the park in late middle age after receiving a curt message from someone telling us that – after all – they don’t think we’re a good idea for them, we might finally concede to the facts with tragic comic bravery: we may in truth just be no good at this.  \nWe might assume that such a recognition would be a prelude to limitless despair and self-condemnation but far from it. We might laugh heartily and kindly. For a very long time. Once we frankly acknowledge that we may not be good at something, we are liberated from shame at not being so. We don’t have to be humiliated every time we stumble on more evidence of our mishaps; we can shrug this off as belonging to a historic handicap we take in our stride.\nWithout discounting our responsibility entirely, we could learn to attribute some of our handicap to forces that exceed our intelligence and strength in the here and now. We aren’t any good in this area not just because we are stupid (though we are that too, of course), but because of some uncommonly complex dynamics in our early years over which we have limited agency. Why do we keep expecting ourselves to succeed at love, given the insanities that transpired around our mother or our father decades ago? Why insist on assuming that it might all unfold smoothly, after the cruelty and the drama?\nThe pain can lessen and compassion increase. We remain hopeless, but the hopelessness doesn’t have to be experienced as only crushing. It doesn’t have to get in the way of a recognition of our remaining stamina and creativity. Our romantic fiascos can get a little less arduous the more we can bring ourselves to shrug our shoulders and confess with a very dark smile: I really can’t do this thing called love.",

One partner feels abandoned; the other feels controlled. And the script, from Taipei to Portland, Basingstoke to Algiers, goes something like this:\nA: You said you were going to call me and you didn’t. For three hours I had no idea where you were. Do you think that’s fun for me? It’s inconsiderate – and rude. I am being taken advantage of. And not for the first time.\nB: I was busy; why do you always criticise me and fly off the handle so fast? I haven’t got any  space, I can’t breathe. Nothing I do is good enough. I’m fed up with you.\n\nPhoto by Etienne Boulanger on Unsplash\n\nA thread has come out of the seam of the relationship. If it keeps being pulled, a whole hem may unspool. \nThis is how one sets about repairing. Firstly, we need to host a very unlikely thought. The person in front of us is not evil. They obviously seem evil, that much is clear. They are evidently out to get us and have the very worst intentions. But really they don’t. They are our partner. They have made big sacrifices to be with us. We were happy once. They are, in different moods, ‘sweetie’ or ‘little bun.’ A while ago, we danced around the kitchen together. We patted their childhood soft toy. They held us when we had a fever. However unlikely it seems, they are in fact on our side. They want this to work.\nNext, we need to stop attacking and do that far more courageous and exhausting thing: explain our hurt. We have to lose our pride and patiently and systematically take the person into our tender, vast fears – presently hidden behind outward sternness and rage:\nA: When you don’t call me, I feel so lonely and bereft.\nB: When I fail to call and you criticise me, I feel hounded and insecure; like I can’t ever get anything right.\nWe might want to add some backstory, to show how we ended up as the challenging people we are today – who are in need of so much mercy from others:\nA: This reminds me of all the times I’ve had to wait and no one came, like I did endlessly after school when mum was having chemo.\nB: This reminds me of being shouted at by dad and feeling I could never win him over.\nIn other words, there are two children inside, they are not in a good way and they need to see one another’s distress if this is ever to be mended.&nbsp;\nA: The child in me feels humiliated.\nB: The child in me feels condemned.\nWere the couple to reach this place, the angels of love would quietly sing their hosannas. Advanced practitioners might conclude by replaying their lessons to one another:\nA: When I go in too hard, I realise you feel like you can never please me; even though you can – and do. \nB: When I let you down with my messaging, I can see it hurts you somewhere very deep. I’m going to try so much harder.\nIf all this sounds silly, it’s vastly sillier still when the shouting goes on all night, when the divorce lawyers are called, when the savings are lost and when small children have to commute across the country to see their parents. We think of love as an emotion; it’s made up of a sequence of hugely basic skills, many of them around explanation, diplomacy and reassurance. And these can be learnt, at a school a bit like this, modestly, without resentment or mockery, piece by infinitely glorious and redemptive piece.&nbsp;",

      "text": "There is a particularly poignant and tormented figure known in psychology as the ‘anxiously attached person’, who may be us, or someone we know. Their tragedy is that they are both deeply invested in finding a satisfying partner – and yet essentially unable to believe, in their hearts, that they could truly secure their loyalty. \nThe anxiously attached are extreme romantics: the ones who listen to the songs, who fall in love with strangers in supermarkets and libraries and who cannot (secretly perhaps) ever imagine a satisfied life on their own. However, for all their professed faith in love, as their name implies, they find it extremely hard to trust that love could eventually go right for them. And therefore, in the most shocking irony, they discover that it seldom does so.\n\nEthel Gabain, The Little Bride, c. 1900\n\nThe reason for their anxiety almost always lies in some form of painful letdown in childhood that has not been accurately charted or mourned. Perhaps their parents divorced. Or mother wasn’t very nice. Or father was cut off. Or someone died. Or a sibling stole all the love. Or there was a nice nanny but she was sent away. Something will have happened to fundamentally shake the anxious person’s faith in the possibility of being cared for reliably and steadily.\nThe anxious person therefore now approaches love with a mixture of enormous compensatory hope – and a misunderstood legacy of terror. Beneath their surface romanticism, they are perpetually afraid that the catastrophe that once occurred will unfold once more. And the more they love, the more they fear.\nAfter a short honeymoon period, their love stories are liable to descend into a litany of preoccupations with the partner’s true intent:\n— The partner is half an hour late with a text message: they are abandoning them.\n— The partner was slightly off on the phone: they have found someone else.\n— The partner has a party to go to to which they’re not invited: they’re mocking them.\n— The partner was too tired for sex last night: they find them revolting.\nBehind their complaints lie two primordial cries: ‘I’m not loved enough’ and ‘I’m about to be left.’\nUnfortunately, the anxious do strictly nothing to help themselves be understood and sympathised with for these bellows. Instead of politely and gently detailing the episodes of childhood neglect that might have inspired them, they go on the attack.&nbsp;\nTheir clinical name is in this sense highly misleading, for the most visible sign of their condition is not anxiety, but anger. The anxious tend to be constantly, unrelentingly cross with their partners for their alleged insufficiencies. They upbraid them for being late, for not completing a task, for laughing at the wrong moment, for having the wrong sort of friends…\nThe anger is not always cleanly delivered. The anxious are among the world’s great sulkers. Panicked that they have been misunderstood, they are drawn to making themselves be so all over again. No one will get me, no one will care – and, in time, they don’t. In fury and grief, the anxious barricade themselves in the bathroom or refuse to pick up the phone, even as they crave for the partner to tell them they adore them, for them to keep calling back – and for them to somehow understand what has never been explained to them.\nCertain anxious types may go in for high-handed lectures squarely and professorially explaining what is ‘wrong’ with their partner. As though they had recently completed a psychotherapy training, they may deliver speeches as to how their partner is ‘avoidant’ and ‘afraid of love,’ ‘defended’ and ‘emotionally immature,’ this in lieu of ever facing up to their own disavowed trepidations.\nIn extremis, anxious people may have an affair, not because they don’t love their partner, but because they’re so scared that they are not loved back, they need to find some way of escaping their feelings of exposure and potential humiliation. Their early experiences have taught them that it must always be better to keep two (or more) options at play.\nThere are naturally cases where the anxious are correct in their assessment of their partners. But in a great many scenarios, the anxious start with no inbuilt cause for complaint. The spectre is in their minds alone. They bring about their own disregard through its aggressive and exhausting apprehension.\nUnsurprisingly, when relationships end (especially precipitously), it’s very often the anxious who have called time on them. And typically, they leave not because they want to but because – whatever the partner may implore them to believe at the moment of break up – they feel they are not wanted. In many a hallway, an anxious partner has told their soon-to-be ex that they are definitely not loved enough, even as the latter insist on their life that the opposite is the case.\nThe anxious are fated to move from partner to partner (multiple divorces are typical), never quite finding the intensity of affection and the reliability they need to assure them that they are safe and cared for, and that they are not about to be cast off as they once were.\nAs ever, the escape is through insight and timely admission. The hope is that the anxious person can learn to teach their partners what they need – rather than hastily doubling down on what they fear; the hope is that they will be able to gently seek reassurance before they give way to the impulse to attack, that they may develop the courage to ask for the love they so badly want – in the kind of patient, open-hearted tone that at last stands a chance of actually being heard.",

      "text": "We won’t really have begun to properly understand human nature until we absorb a hugely awkward and strange sounding fact: we collectively seem to spend as much time avoiding love as we do pursuing it. We devote inordinate energy to skirting the possibility of successful relationships in which there might be a chance of mutual tenderness, recognition, kindness and intimacy. And instead, we throw ourselves into a variety of unfulfilling situations marked by isolation, frustration, and distance – terrible in a sense but with the advantage of sparing us the challenges that (deep down, in the underground parts of the mind) we associate with emotional fulfilment.\n\nHenri Matisse, Bathers with a Turtle, 1908\n\nThe sheer ingenuity with which we strategise to refuse love is impressive. Here’s a person who falls in love only with married people. Here’s another who, the moment a relationship gets serious, has to cool and find a way to exit. Here’s someone else who limits their passion to passers-by they will never speak to. Here’s someone who obsesses about an ex they had in high school and for whom they turn down everybody they meet for the subsequent sixty years. Here’s someone who, the moment they find someone who seems to like them, succeeds in alienating them through aggression or mood swings. Here’s someone who sabotages relationships by becoming highly concerned (for no reason) with their health or career. Here’s someone who is compelled to betray every partner who promises to be loyal to them.&nbsp;\nThe behaviours may be varied but the very same thing holds them together. The reason why we turn down love is as fundamental as it is – from some angles – humiliating, cliched and boring. We do so because love failed for us in childhood. We’re avoiding love now because somewhere in the past, it proved intolerably distressing in a way that we have not understood – and therefore cannot overcome.\nThere might have been a parent or caregiver who couldn’t tolerate our vulnerability; or who bullied us, or blew hot and cold, or died on us, or seduced us, or preferred a sibling, or made us feel they only cared for our achievements, or was threatened by our achievements, or couldn’t tolerate our gender or our intelligence or our sportiness or our hesitation.&nbsp;\nWe know so much about our longing for love. We talk so little about the terrors love holds for a good portion of the population (it might be as much as forty percent). We haven’t found an easy way to discuss how frightening it can be that someone might finally want to cuddle us and believe in us – after we have suffered for so long in loneliness, after our whole personalities have been shaped by an imperative to adapt to frustration, after we have had to kill trust in the face of constant betrayal, after we have been miserably confused by the mixture of cruelty and kindness served up by those closest to us. How sickening that someone might now promise us life-long commitment or tell us unadulteratedly sweet and gentle things. What relief we find from our dread of intimacy when we can manage to engineer an impasse: when we can safely fall in love with someone who is dead or lives three continents away or has another family or whom we can drive away through anger and unreliability.\nTo be helpful, and to warn ourselves, we might need to hazard a prediction: if love didn’t go well for us as children, we will almost certainly have problems tolerating love as adults. However much we may tell ourselves that we are just freely seeking happy love, a part of us will be furiously devising clever and disguised ways in which we won’t find it after all. At social occasions, it will steer us – as if by magic – always to the ones who don’t care. At moments of opportunity, it will render us argumentative or mute, self-hating or restless. \nWe say this not to depress us but to help us see a danger that will otherwise reside simply in the unconscious parts of the mind. Our childhoods have taught us overwhelmingly yet silently that love was not safe. It is open to us to realise what we have imbibed until now and to make sure that we can henceforth – via a lot of reflection and courage – gradually learn to bear the tension, unfamiliarity and terrifying beauty of genuine love.",

      "text": "Is it ever worth trying to shore up a relationship with someone who exhibits traits associated with what psychologists term ‘avoidance’, in other words, with someone who is extremely reticent about displaying and receiving affection and who seems in many ways better suited to a life alone than in a couple?\n\nOtto Dix, Self-Portrait, 1912\n\nLet’s assume, for the purposes of this essay (and in full knowledge that there are plenty of cases where this won’t apply), that the answer might be a tentative ‘yes’; that there is here no risk of outright abuse and that the person under consideration is kind and responsive enough for their difficulties to merit a degree of patience and exploration. How then might we try to get a relationship with them onto a better footing? Five ideas present themselves:\n1. Understand their diagnosis\nPart of the difficulty of handling an avoidant person lies in being clear exactly what the issue with them might be. It can be extremely tempting to mistake avoidant behaviour for two things: hatred towards us. And, a related conclusion, evidence that there is something wrong with us. If we side with either of these two (hugely painful) interpretations, we will never be able to get beyond offended hurt on the one hand and self-contempt on the other. We may have to hold on to the thought that the partner is afflicted by a well-charted psychological condition that existed long before we came on the scene, that makes no reference to anything about us and that though it may frustrate us, is not deliberately aimed at causing us harm. The reason that our partner is the way they are is that somewhere in their early lives, as in the early lives of every avoidant person (a category that may comprise as many as 25% of the population), there will have been a very unfulfilling and painful bond with a primary caregiver or parent, there will have been neglect, violence or humiliation and from this, a powerful impression will have been formed: ‘Relationships with others are dangerous’. And: ‘I can only be substantially safe when I am alone; others cannot meet my needs.’&nbsp;\n2. The avoidant person is terrified\nThe avoidant wants love as much as any of us; they are simply too terrified to tolerate it when it arrives. At its approach, they fear that their carefully built defences against others will be stripped from them and that they will be hurt by someone once more as they were in their infancy. If we can keep this in mind, we can look at much of what the avoidant person does through a more tolerant lens: they have gone into the next room not because they are bored by us but because they are at some level apprehensive of, and drained by us. They are spending so much time with their friends not because they don’t want us, but because they are afraid that their dependence on us exposes them to untenable risks. The behaviour may continue to be sub-optimal, its interpretation may dampen the worst of its effects.&nbsp;\n3. Self-awareness\nThere is an enormous difference between an avoidant person who knows that they are such a thing and one who angrily refuses any suggestion of their diagnosis. Insight may not stop the behaviour entirely but it can encourage the sufferer to explain what they are doing, to apologise for the consequences and to take measures to alter themselves. Once a person can say ‘I’m so sorry that I’m avoidant, I will try to watch myself and take this to therapy,’ an important part of the battle is won.&nbsp;\n4. Helping them feel less engulfed\nWe know that someone who has suffered a trauma to their digestive system will not be able to eat too much too soon. We need, in handling avoidants, to apply some of the same logic around emotional nourishment. We may need to cut our love for them up into small pieces. We may need to shield them from the full glare of our affection. We may need not to send them too many messages. We may have to emphasise our more independent moods. We might have to deploy humour to get a paradox across, ‘I know this is going to worry you, but I’m afraid I love you a lot…’\n5. The problem is mutual\nHowever, what will ultimately help us to deal with an avoidant partner is for us to confront a highly provocative truth about ourselves: they are not the only ones with a problem. We aren’t here by coincidence. We could have left them politely after the first date, when we will almost certainly – at an unconscious level – have first sensed their issue. We didn’t have to fall in love; we didn’t have to keep coming back. If we did, it’s because there is something in us that keeps wanting to be here. It may look as though they are unwell, and we are wholly healthy, because they are refusing love and we have a rich ability to offer it to them. But the underlying reality is different. If we offer love to people who don’t seem to much want it, if our deepest attractions are for people who can’t easily absorb our affections, then we are not too well either. We too must be scared of reciprocity, we too must be avoiding the intensity and vulnerability of a properly functioning relationship, most likely because in our childhoods, one of our parents was avoidant. It may look as if we are enthusiasts of tenderness, but we have in the end merely offshored out own incapacities; we are pointing to someone else’s problem in lieu of reflecting on our own more camouflaged version. If we were approached by someone infinitely warm, kind and present (as we probably have been a few times in our lives), we would in all likelihood run for the hills and exhibit all the reticence, fear and evasiveness we complain of in our partner. \nOnce we know this of ourselves, we can move into a position of greater sympathy. We’re dealing with a joint issue that simply displays its most visible signs in them; but both of us are in truth emotionally compromised. Both of us are scared, we’ve just handled the fear slightly differently: they by spending a lot of time alone, we – not coincidentally but more subtly – by falling in love with someone who needs to spend a lot of time alone. \nWe can take mutual responsibility for our tattered condition, stop name calling, and move hand in hand towards one day being able to meet the ecstasies and terrors of love with greater trust and hope.",

So it may come as a surprise that in all likelihood, these couples would do nothing of the sort. Through our recording equipment, we might hear some of the following: one of them starting to wonder why bananas grow in an oblong curved shape, the other – not quite listening – going off on a tangent about an ulcer they’ve got on the left side of their tongue while filing a toenail and half glancing at an airline review video on YouTube, which might be followed by the other speculating (for no apparent reason, in a bad imitation of a German accent) on the lyrics in an album by Dire Straits, which might be a prelude to their partner suggesting that they wanted to follow up on last night’s reheated curry with a chocolate biscuit dipped in strawberry yoghurt.&nbsp;\nIt might sound like regressive nonsense and in key ways it is, but we might want to maintain that this sort of incoherent chatter should also be considered one of the high-water marks of emotional intimacy and in its way, a bellwether of the most serious kinds of interpersonal closeness. People who know each other extremely well and love one another deeply, do not – it appears – sit together discussing philosophy or the accelerator theory in economics, they shoot the breeze, they swerve here and there, they talk shit and this, far from being some kind of distraction or unfortunate lapse, is a strange and profound proof of the depths of their mutual affection. Intimacy is about daring to be increasingly and bravely weird with someone else – and finding out that that’s OK with them.\nIn the recesses of all of our minds flows a stream of consciousness that mixes the serious and the unserious, the consequential and the flighty, the physical and the emotional. And when we have allowed ourselves to be genuinely close to someone, it is to this that we take them; we do them the honour of showing them who we actually are, not who we should or pretend to be – a privilege we grant only to a handful of people in our lives. Everyone else may know our sensible selves; they’ve been introduced to, and know how to love and take an interest in a naughty sweet curious and highly peculiar babbling child.\nWhen we talk about nothing in particular we’re doing something even more significant than when we attempt to say rational and logical things: we are allowing someone into the primordial parts of ourselves that the rules of society otherwise censor. We are doing one of the most courageous and important things in the world: allowing someone else to know us.",

      "text": "Choosing a long-term partner may be the single most consequential decision any of us ever has to make. No wonder we can get a little scared on dates. If we get the choice right, we may enjoy supportiveness, cosiness and intimacy for the rest of our lives; if we get it wrong, our confidence, health, financial wherewithal and sanity will be on the line.\nEngland’s greatest novelist, Jane Austen, spent her career writing almost exclusively about her characters’ quests to locate a suitable mate. As critics have pointed out, in the world outside her study, Britain was fighting a war of survival against Napoleonic France, but Austen never saw fit to mention the conflict even once, so busy was she telling us about who blushed on seeing whom at which party. One might smirk, but her priorities may have been correct. War is indeed a very serious matter; choosing a partner is properly monumental one.&nbsp;\n\nJames Andrews, Portrait of Jane Austen (posthumous), 1869\n\nWhat then are some of the most weighty mistakes we make when attempting to find a lover?\n1. Our Terror of Loneliness\nMuch of the reason for our unhappy romantic lives comes down to our dread of the single state. So terrified are we of our own company and of the persistent humiliations of the dating rigmarole, we become fatefully generous towards mediocre partners who may – over time – end up making us feel far lonelier and more miserable than if we were merely on our own. The single greatest guarantor of contented love is a capacity to endure one’s own company.\n2. The Sunk Cost Fallacy\nWe stay because we have already been here for so long: because it’s already far too late, given that we’re 21, or 39 or 104. We think relentlessly of the 3 months, five years or two decades that we’ve already spent with a person, with all the hope implied – and thereby overlook that a short happy future is always worth more than a lengthy fractious past. We forget too that though people may occasionally change, they seem never to do so when one politely asks them to.\n3. Muddled Assumptions of Better Alternatives\nOf course they’re a bit awful, the question is whether one is dealing with an especially obtuse sort or just another member of our collectively maddening species. We’re always choosing from a pool, and we need – to a maximal extent – to know what other kinds of creatures swim in it. Our level of calm years from now is going to depend on having built up – through experience – a fair and robust sense of what an acceptable degree of frustration might be. Anyone can find someone annoying; the true skill is to have determined the relative inevitability of their vexatiousness, to know how to distinguish hysterical misery from normal unavoidable unhappiness.\n4. A Hatred of Love\nWe may spend a great many years pushing away anyone with the gall to try to love us. Our repulsion tends to have its roots in difficult childhoods in which we built up an association between intimacy on the one hand and pain on the other; between closeness and suffering. We now suspect that anyone who is sweet must be deluded for identifying in us a lovability that we don’t recognise in ourselves. Happy love may be what we crave; it isn’t necessarily what we can remotely tolerate.&nbsp;\n5. The Appeal of Madness\nIt can take a long time to develop immunity to the appeal of those who blow hot and cold, hate themselves, refuse our affection, deceive us and fall into rages and despair late at night. We may be deep into middle age before we cotton onto the extraordinary merits and subtle exoticism of sane reliable ‘boring’ people, who trust others, go to therapy, garden, like themselves and love their parents.\n6. The Tragedies of Defensiveness\nIt’s the character trait that single handedly dooms more relationships than any other – and means that when one gently raises a complaint against a partner, they reply that this isn’t a good time, that it’s one’s own fault, that there is in fact no problem, that one is being mean and that this is all too much. It’s a blessed day when one lands on a human who, thanks to the love of early caregivers, utters the magical words: ‘How interesting, I hear you… You might have a point… Let me have a think about what you’re saying…’\n7. Underestimating the Cumulative Impact of Character Flaws\nWe tell ourselves that it’s only a little thing, just a small tendency in them to do x or y or z. Then again, a pebble is also only a very small thing but if we have one in our shoe and we are running a marathon, after a mile our foot will be soaked in blood.&nbsp;\n8. Underestimating Physical Attraction\nIt’s a criterion that clever people (like us) are especially prone to neglecting. Surely sexual appeal shouldn&#8217;t detain us for too long when choosing a mate? Surely there are more important things to think at length about than who might be submissive and who dominant? But this is to overlook how many arguments are at heart about a resentment over absent sex and conversely how much one can forgive a mate after a satisfying twenty minutes together. Given that sex is (unlike good conversation or advice) typically the only thing that we’re not legitimately allowed to seek outside a couple, we should make sure that the kind we are having in it is uncommonly satisfying.&nbsp;\n9. Perfectionism\nOur chances of making a good enough choice increase the more we recognise the impossibility of making a perfect one. Our marriages improve as we concede that we will – naturally – inevitably marry slightly the wrong person – but only because there is no such thing as the fully ‘right’ sort. Gods can marry paragons; we are fated to have to cope with just another demented sweet silly fool much like us. The most contented marriages rest on a bed of consoling, forgiving, gentle laughter-filled pessimism.",

Or, put more bluntly: did you work hard to make yourself known before surrendering to a sense of being unnoticed?\n\nMark Rothko, Untitled, 1952-3\n\nThe reason we might need to probe like this comes down to a paradoxical element in our psyches; the feeling that we have not been heard may not necessarily or inevitably be preceded by any active devotion to speaking. It’s possible to long to be listened to while evading any substantial effort at explanation. It can be easier to assume that no one has wanted to listen than to acknowledge an underlying inhibition about opening our mouths.\nAt the heart of a failure to speak is a profound pessimism as to the likelihood of successful dialogue, typically a legacy of a childhood in an environment in which no one was especially interested in hearing of our pains or confusions. The adults would have been too drunk or violent, busy or cruel – and from their neglect, we concluded that there could be no alternative to swallowed anger, unmentioned hopes and tightly-furled resentments. \nOr we might make attempts at communication but in ways that we deep down know will fail – and thereby confirm our sombre world view. We kick off conversations at 11pm, when everyone is exhausted and perspective is hard to find. We choreograph scenarios in which we are almost certain our points will be missed. Feeling overlooked feels – in the end – too much like ‘home.’ \nWe should be clearer with ourselves. Before despairing, we should wonder: Have I properly explained what I am so convinced I have been ignored for? Have I put into audible words that I want more opportunities to see my friends? Or that I want something different in bed? Or don’t appreciate being upbraided for sometimes being late? We spend so much of our lives resenting that others have not grasped what we have never – in fact – had the courage to tell them.\nA large part of any good relationship must involve the exhausting yet critical task of teaching the other person about who we are, which means waiting for a propitious moment, being confident in our right to speak, deploying humour and diplomacy and refraining from insulting the partner when they fail immediately to grasp our intentions.\nThose who are overlooked deserve genuine sympathy. They should not be confused with those among us who might lean on a feeling being misunderstood as a careful alternative to the challenges of speaking.",

      "text": "There are, of course, exceptions: buddies who know all about intimacy and cosiness, camaraderie and connection. But let’s state the darker and more general truth plainly: friendship is difficult for men. For every man who can claim a decent male friend, there must be at least eight who – in the honesty of their deep minds – know they have none that truly merit the term. \nThe problem – though it strikes at an individual level – is anchored in larger societal forces. Men are lonely not through any specific deficiency on their part but because of an inherent conflict between what is required of being a man on the one hand and what is involved in being a friend on the other.\n\nPeter Paul Rubens, Self-Portrait in a Circle of Friends of Mantua, 1602\n\nThe bedrock of true friendship is – unfortunately – mutual vulnerability. We may, naturally, foster a friendship by discussing how many goals Manchester United scored in the year of the last World Cup or how hypersonic aeroplane engines work or the average return of an S&amp;P 500 stock. There can be a certain interest in thinking together about the classical influence within Picasso’s late period, or the idea of justice in Plato&#8217;s The Laws or the influence of Plotinus on early Renaissance thought.\nBut genuine friendship, the sort that nourishes and sustains, that argues against despair and helps with the eeriness of the early hours, has to begin somewhere else. It starts the moment that one person says to another: ‘I’m going out of mind’; ‘I hate my partner’s guts’; ‘I’m terrified’. Or: ‘Help me’. It starts when a man can admit: ‘I’m in love with a colleague’; ‘I can’t get it up any more’. Or: ‘the anxiety never stops’. There won’t be a friendship that properly counts until we can reveal ourselves to be as weak as we are, until we can confess that we have been lying to preserve face and that the truth is far ghastlier and sadder, far more tender and more bathetic than we’ve yet been able to let on.\nRegrettably for men, since the earliest days, across civilisations, it has been self-evident that to be a man involves something else entirely: being unflinching and solid, unperturbed and straightforward, buoyant and resourceful. It’s about not minding that we’ve been left or sacked, humiliated or bullied. It’s about never losing an erection and knowing how to rule an empire without taking to bed and pining for mother. It’s ultimately about never, ever being that most dreaded and abhorrent of things: a crybaby.\nThe best way to break the loneliness must be to admit with humour and grace that it exists and that one may be more than fed up that it does so. Of course men often don’t know how to be close. Of course they might be substantially friendless. It should be no surprise if they’ve never had an honest conversation with another member of their gender. Little in their histories allows for such an eventuality.&nbsp;\nIf we were tempted to make a practical change, we might design some packs of conversation cards and give them out to men take with them to the bar and the pub, the shooting range and the golf club. On them would be printed a range of questions of a kind that men might long to ask one another and seldom can:&nbsp;\n— When did you last cry?\n— What would you want to tell me if you knew I wouldn’t judge you?\n— When do you feel most anxious?\n— What makes you despair?\n— What do you want to be forgiven for?\n— What does the small boy inside you feel?\nMost would agree that such cards were – naturally – idiotic and unnecessary. But how useful they might be if they provided even a small opportunity for a few men to let down their guard and reveal a more complex reality.\nThe histories of art and literature are all the proof one might require that men are capable of the greatest empathy and tenderness. The tragedy is that men are so seldom able to direct these emotions towards one another, that they must spend their lives barricaded in themselves, in dread of becoming, in the eyes of their fellow men, a child or a woman, that they must waste so much time and be so brave in defending an illusion that they never asked to be a part of.",

It tends to feel highly incongruous to try to interrupt the normal panicked, stern or critical way we speak to ourselves for the sake of a moment of stillness and nurture. It can be infinitely easier to look after someone else than to direct generosity inwards.\nIt may in this context help to try out a minor imaginative exercise: to picture ourselves as being, alongside our normal duties, always responsible for looking after a small child, a distinctly sensitive five year old, who happens to be a version of our younger selves.\n\nPhoto by Mostafa Saeed on Unsplash\n\nImagine that throughout an average day, we aren’t going to be the only ones showing up and handling matters. We will be accompanied at all times by a far more intrepid, vulnerable, sleepy, delicate, sweet and very shy five year old. There will be a five year old coming with us to our workplace presentation. There will be a five year old in tow when we have to meet colleagues from the Korean branch – and have to take them out for lunch and make small talk for an hour. This small person will then have to make a difficult phone call to a supplier who will try to catch them out. Later on, they will need to go to a party at which they don’t know very many people and where they will be set the task of trying to make some friends. And then they’ll have to find a taxi or somehow make it back home on a very late train.\nLooked at through the eyes of an adult, these prospects are unlikely to attract much attention or sympathy from our pilot selves. This is just what we’re used to; we know what we have to do and we’ll do it competently enough. But considered through the eyes of a five year old, we start to get a fairer picture of the threatening and draining dimensions of what we have to confront on a typical day. When we think of what it would take for a five year old to have to deal with a room full of strangers or to have to sit politely during a long meeting or to be tasked with plotting a route home, we begin to get a more vivid and more accurate sense of what we have grown dangerously used to making light of, of the genuine difficulties to which we have grown inured, of the brave mask we have forgotten we are even wearing.\nThis matters because pains that we don’t acknowledge have a habit of undermining us until we pay them attention. They will exact a toll even if we look away from them and put on a show of strength, manifesting themselves in subsidiary forms, in migraines, depressions, backaches and waves of anxiety or anger. We are – most of us – leading lives that are at points simply far too arduous for us to bear, but which we have forgotten to interpret, mourn and comfort ourselves for.\nWe are – luckily – natively generally far better at looking after children. Faced with a five year old, we mostly know what to do; we understand where the threats and tensions might lie for a small person. We know to look out for when a child is sleepy or hasn’t eaten properly, we know how draining it is for a child to have to meet someone new or to perform in public or to get themselves organised when there is little time. Our heart goes out to them. ‘Poor poppet’ we might mutter under our breath when we think of what this tiny being is going to have to deal with and how much fear or tiredness they might feel. \nWe should import this tender concern into our treatment of ourselves: we too are in the end in part a five year old, we too get sleepy and scared and confused and very very apprehensive. And we suffer all the more for not allowing ourselves to know this clearly, for assuming that we are older than we are.&nbsp;\nGoing forward, as we consider an average day, we should try to take a moment to ask ourselves some deliberately naive sounding and oddly sweet-natured questions:\n— How would a five year old cope with the morning we have?\n— How would they deal with the lunchtime?\n— How might they feel about the afternoon?\n— How might they be feeling towards evening?\nWe aren’t thereby patronising ourselves. In the most adult of ways, we’re acknowledging the debt we owe to the more fragile, historic parts of us. We’ll accede to a fairer, calmer, kinder adulthood once we accept with grace how close we remain always to the delicate, sensitive, tear-prone little person we once were.",

      "text": "Some of the darkest moments of our lives are those in which we make the sudden discovery that someone whom we had believed loved us actually hates us profoundly. Though we had trusted that they were on our side, when we stumble on the journal that they left on the sofa in the living room, we read to our dismay that they apparently find our habits pretentious and our way of speaking ‘fake’. Or at a party, we overhear them saying something very unflattering and mean-spirited about our clothes or our job prospects. Or we find out that they sent a flirtatious text to a colleague while they were lying next to us in bed.\n\nGlyn Philpot, St Sebastian, 1932\n\nAnd from these instances, there seems only one conclusion to be drawn: the friend or partner can’t bear us. Nothing they say from here, however eloquent or impassioned, can persuade us otherwise. They may try to make it up to us with honeyed words. But we know the truth; which is why we are sobbing in our room and will never, ever be able to forgive them.\nAt such painful moments, we would do well to summon up an idea which we may have a very hard time holding on to but which promises to transform or at the very least nuance our desperate certainties: the idea that it is possible to harbour all kinds of extremely negative and critical things about a person – and yet still fundamentally and sincerely adore them. \nFor evidence of this thesis, we need only consult one highly reputable souce: our own minds. When we dare to examine ourselves honestly, we find that we’re constantly entertaining some distinctly unfaithful thoughts about others without these in any fundamental way imperilling our affection for them. We can deeply revere a family member, while noting that they are really rather unpleasant looking (especially their nose and, more recently, their hair). We can hugely respect a friend, and yet experience them as irritatingly self-important in public. We can feel very close to a loved one and yet not want to invite them to a party because there are things about them that embarrass us. And we can enjoy flirting with a colleague and yet remain wholly committed to our partner.&nbsp;\nIn other words, from the evidence of our own minds, we know (or at least have the wherewithal to know) that love and kindness can easily exist alongside judgmentalness, deceit, cowardice, cattiness and treachery.\nYet however much we understand this in theory about ourselves, we appear largely unable to allow for a comparable complexity in others. They – unlike us – are either with us or against us. They must entirely love us or else have to be assumed to hate us They must be fundamentally on our side or can be counted as deep enemies. We can’t permit them to entertain any of the scrutiny, disapproval or pettiness that continually run through our consciousness. And as a result, we are far more prone to upset – and distrust – than we might be. \nThe explanation for this moral asymmetry may have its roots in a tender place: in the way our parents and caregivers behaved around us in childhood. From the best of motives, these adults may have hidden their blunter thoughts from us and suggested a purity of feeling which gave us a distorted picture of what reliable love must involve. They may have assiduously disguised that they didn’t always like our appearance or thought us a bit whiny or were sometimes bored by our conversation or in some ways preferred hanging out with our sibling – truths that might have been both very painful and wholly compatible with love.\nHad we known that our early caregivers were not in fact always ‘kind’ in every way (and might have quietly celebrated when we finally went to bed or when school restarted), then we would not have needed to place our own bar of loyalty so high – or grown so cross and offended when others failed to reach it. \nWhen we next learn that a partner thinks we should lose some weight or prefers someone else’s company in a museum, we may hold on to an initially painful yet ultimately redemptive truth: they may still love us very much indeed. We have just been operating with a false picture of what love entails. We may be far more loved than we thought – once we remember, by the evidence of our own minds, the scale of the reservations that true love can encompass.",

      "text": "One of the most instructive stories in Greek mythology is to be found in Book 12 of Homer’s Odyssey, where the central figure, Odysseus, king of Ithaca, is described as having to sail past an island inhabited by some compelling female figures known as the Sirens, famous for luring sailors to their deaths on their island’s rocky shoreline by the sound of their song. \n\nH. R. Draper, Ulysses and the Sirens, c. 1909\n\nDetermined to avoid their fate, Odysseus devises a plan. As he approaches the island, he asks his sailors to tie him to the mast and to put beeswax in their ears and then to disregard any pleas he might subsequently make, however impassioned. Sure enough, Odysseus loses his reason and begs his sailors to get closer to the Sirens, but the rope tying him to the mast remains firm, the sailors follow their original orders and the ship sails on unharmed. Odysseus becomes the only mortal ever to have heard the song of the Sirens and lived.\nThe story is enduring, because for all its fancy, it defines a mental manoeuvre that every good life should at points have recourse to. There are situations in which we have to concede that no finely-wrought philosophical arguments in favour of wisdom will be effective – and that only the blunt removal of temptation can save us. When we are faced with lures which we are not strong enough to talk ourselves out of, we have to give others powers of attorney over us. We must willingly accept to be treated as children in order for precious parts of our adulthood to be preserved. We must accept without rancour the humiliating fact that we will simply lose control.\nThe threats to our reasonableness might include an ex who ruined years of our life but whom we long to call late at night in order to beg for another chance, or a teenage child who irritates us unbearably but with whom we should never get into an argument or an office colleague whom we must do our best to ignore or a chocolate biscuit we can’t stop eating once we start, or a site on the internet we must never revisit.\nWe each have our own version of the Sirens, precisely tailored to the faultlines of our minds. When we have these fully in view, without too much loss of dignity, we must gather our ‘sailors’, with whom we navigate our lives, and cede to them a temporary right to take away the tiller of our destiny. We must hand our friends our phones, give them the plug to our computer, tell them not to allow us into the shop and ask them to monitor whom we have called.\nNone of it is edifying but it is in the end even less edifying to pretend that we can always lay claim to a reasonableness that is in reality only ever intermittently ours. The truly mature know when maturity is no longer an option. There are moments when for a true friend to listen to us entails – in effect – not listening to us because ‘we’ have lost command of our executive functions, as we typically will, when shame, loneliness and despair grip us. We need to be sane enough to say to those who care for us: ‘I am sufficiently strong to know how weak I am; protect me from what I want; do me the kindness of tying me very tightly to a mast…’",

      "text": "The pain exacted by the unwanted end of a relationship will always be significant for the abandoned party – but this does not, crucially, mean that it must always be equal.\nThere are relationships where, despite a lot of regret and surprise, the sadness can in time feel bearable. The loss can be mourned; the melancholy can lift. And then there are situations where, despite the best efforts of attentive friends and therapists, the agony goes on without apparent end.\nThe difference lies in a feature of love to which we collectively pay far too little attention: the nature of the closure. There is an enormous distinction between an ending with a so-called good closure, in which the wounded party is offered a thorough, plausible, polite and honest-without-being-devastating explanation of why they were rejected – and one without. In a good closure, a departing lover might calmly and without guilt or fear lay out that a relationship ended because (let’s imagine): there was too much geographical distance, or cultural barriers got in the way, or ultimately there was too much of a gap in terms of respective attachment styles. \n\nCamille Pissarro, Sunset at Èragny, 1890\n\nWith a good closure, one might expect to be very sad for a few weeks or months. Without one, the agony might marr years. When we are denied a proper explanation, a part of the mind thinks that there must be some sort of ‘mistake’ and if there is one, that it can then surely be corrected. The abandoned party will plot obsessively for fresh contact and ruin their future in naive expectations of reconciliation. Few things are worse than a departing lover acts who says vaguely and sweetly: I will always love you, nothing can stop that – and then ambiguously slopes off. True kindness means throttling hope at the earliest opportunity.\nWhen there are no sound reasons for the ending, the mind will necessarily gravitate to the most awful ones: They loathe me. I disgusted them. They have someone else. It may not – in truth – be anything like as bad. But few minds can resist visiting such grottoes in the early hours.\nIn a better arranged society, no one would be allowed to leave a relationship without an adequate closure conversation. There would be an expectation of three discussions at least over as many days, in which a departing person would lay out their reasons with formal intent. They might say: My respect for you is immense, but in the end, I needed more freedom than you could comfortably provide. Or: I know that my manner will always frustrate you, but I don’t think I can realistically change the way I am in the time-frame you are looking for and want to avoid years of friction that would have a heavy toll on both of us. There would be tears and anger, but not paranoia or ambiguity. We can endure so much when our ‘whys’ have been quelled.\nMany relationships cannot realistically be resurrected; all relationships deserve kindly, dignified and thoughtful burials.&nbsp;",

      "text": "In an attempt to explain the often puzzling phenomenon of male heterosexual impotence, psychologists have at points offered us one especially provocative thesis: a man may be unable to perform with a woman because he is – in his unconscious – afflicted by a powerful subterranean fear of being castrated by her.\nGiven that real-life incidents of castration are extremely rare, even as rates of impotence remain extremely high, the fear evidently cannot be based on any assessment of reality. However,  cases of impotence (where there is no physiological issue at play) do indeed tend to involve strong feelings of dread, discomfort and shame, which might be creatively expressed in a metaphorical fear that one’s penis may not survive intercourse unharmed.\n\nDetail from the Belvedere Apollo\n\nPsychologists go on to tell us that what generally determines a man’s degree of castration anxiety is the history of his relationships with important female figures in his formative years. The more a man experiences these figures as being – fundamentally – sympathetic to his potency and unfrightened by his masculinity, the more he stands to be able to succeed sexually in time. And the more he experiences a risk of belittlement, suffering or humiliation, the more he is likely to feel that not just his ego, but also, his penis may be unwelcome in an intimate setting. \nA woman on the receiving end of impotence will often touchingly wonder: ‘What might be wrong with me?’ The poignant answer is of course ‘nothing at all’; but she may nevertheless have to pay the price for a problem in the man’s relationship with a woman somewhere down the line, a problem to which he has not given sufficient thought and which he has not been able to master.\nThe more a woman can trust that the man has failed to be turned on not by her per se, but that he has a history of terror that his masculinity may be under siege in a broad sense, the more occasions of impotence can be interpreted as interesting, comedic, human and, in their way, extremely moving.\n‘I am apparently deep down afraid that I may not make it out of you with my penis intact’ is one of the less intuitive phrases that one can ever share with someone in bed. But it can also be an uncommonly brave, funny and maybe true thing to utter as well.\nWe should concede that both genders can carry aggressions and suspicions of one another that, while not justified by anything in present reality, reflect difficult experiences they have had on their way to adulthood. If sex is going wrong, we may need to look beyond physical interventions – candles, soft music or massages – and take an audit of the mutual suspicions that each side can be unconsciously carrying with them into the bedroom. And then offer mutual reassurance that whatever the aggressions and wounds of the past, there is no reason why safety might not be a possibility in the present.\nThe concept of castration anxiety reminds us that potency is to a large extent a psychological achievement. It is a critical legacy of early supportiveness and encouragement; it is one of the more surprising and more critical consequences of love.",

Was mum around? Were they at ease with them? Did they feel loved? How much could they trust them? How much honesty was possible?\n\nSantiago Rusiñol, Blue Courtyard, 1913\n\nWhat we would be trying to do thereby is to determine the tenor and form of what psychotherapists call, in technical language, the other’s ‘negative transference.’ We’d be finding out what happened to them in their past to help us forecast some of what they might presume of our intentions in the future.\nTransference is the ungainly term used by psychotherapists to refer to patterns of expectation that are formed in childhood around parental figures and which are then typically layered – or projected – onto friends, colleagues and lovers in the present, sadly in ways that we can’t easily track and that can lead to some unnecessarily painful conflicts and self-defeating behaviours. \nWe are all prone to negative transferences not because we are individually deficient but because, until we have unpicked our histories, we will automatically use our childhoods as guides to our adulthoods, without noticing how much we may thereby be disregarding the actions and words of the often very different and frequently far less blameworthy people in front of us.\nUnder the sway of a negative transference, an unreliable mother may inspire a suspicion that any woman we are close to is likely to betray us. Or an angry father may breed an apprehension that rage and punitive condemnation will be around the corner with every man we might be with.&nbsp;\nIf there was a parent who offered our partner love only in return for scholarly achievement, we may expect that at some point – it could be a year from now – we could run into accusations from them that we only care about their salary or simply want to show them off to our friends. If our partner harbours fury at their parent for the way they ignored them in favour of a younger sibling, we could be closely monitored for signs of interest in new acquaintances.\nWhen negative transferences are at play, the facts on the ground cease to be decisive; it’s what we fear will happen that dominates our reading of reality. And in a particularly painful and ironic twist, downbeat presumptions may bring about the very scenarios one dreads. Being aggressively accused of wanting to have an affair can eventually drive the most innocent person in the direction of having one. Being repeatedly accused of withdrawing emotionally can finally lead even a mature person to pull away.&nbsp;\nBecause it is never just one member of the couple who carries negative transferences, we need to be as curious about our own distortions as about the other’s and as ready to admit to the possibility of unfair accusations and aggression. We need to meditate on a set of simple questions:\n— What might my mother’s behaviour have taught me to expect of women?\n— How did what happened around my father shape what I believe of men?\n— And what might I, as a result, be getting wrong?\nThe mood between a couple over this issue should be filled with humour and compassion. Of course we will both be, at points, shockingly deluded as to what is unfolding but the more we can accept our proclivities without shame, the less self-righteous or brittle we need to be when they manifest themselves.\nThe hallmark of a functioning relationship should be bravery on those frequent delicate occasions when we might just have to smile in wry acknowledgement at the apparently playful but deep down supremely important and thought-provoking suggestion that:&nbsp;This is perhaps more about your mother or father than about me…&nbsp;",

What had originally seemed like a clear cut and soundly-based decision can – after a few weeks or months – come under fresh scrutiny, and inspire intense doubt, regret, shame, insomnia and at points, hurried attempts to reverse a decision.\n\nPhoto by BĀBI on Unsplash\n\nFor example, a few months ago, it seemed absolutely right to end our relationship. We had the partner’s faults clearly in view and we were certain that these made any sensible plans for the future untenable. But now we’re no longer so sure. We’ve been on a few dates and they didn’t go too well. We’ve been by ourselves a lot and as we’ve been doing the laundry or walking around the park, we’ve started to remember how funny and clever, sweet and tender our ex could be. We’re wondering whether we should, despite our original recommendation that neither of us should be in touch for a while, perhaps send them a falsely innocent text tonight.\nOr, last summer, we knew we didn’t have a particularly good time at the beach side resort and vowed to stick to a cooler climate next time. But since then the weather has turned very cold and just recently, we’re finding ourselves curious about returning south next year.\nOr we told ourselves that we were fully done with a particular career. But we’ve been reflecting on matters since and happened to bump into an old colleague last week – and are now wondering whether we shouldn’t maybe make another attempt.\nOr a friend from university has suggested a meal. We found them rather self-centred and dull when we last saw them a decade ago, but they sounded sparky in their invitation and we’ve agreed to meet them for lunch near the station next week.\nIn such instances, it can be useful to keep a broad principle in mind. The further away we stand from the moment when we took a decision, the more our judgement is likely to be clouded and corrupted.&nbsp;\nAnd this is because of a feature of our minds that – in most areas – serves us extremely well: our capacity to let go of pain. The very faculty that means we can effectively mourn the death of a pet or a loved one or get over a bankruptcy or endure a drop in income also means that we are likely to revise our views of an ex we worked very sensibly to eject from our lives or that will know within five minutes of remeeting an acquaintance that they are as maddening as they ever were.\nWe pick apart and dissolve our judgements because we cannot keep a clear eye on the powerful incentives we come under to do so; because we don’t notice how indigestible certain truths have become. We abdicate to doubt under intolerable, irrepressible degrees of loneliness and sadness, isolation and confusion. Of course we’re going to start to question our views of our ex’s strengths and weaknesses after seven weekends substantially on our own being humiliated on dating apps. Of course we won’t remember our friend’s dispiriting character when we would so love to have a flourishing social life.\nWhen we wake up and wonder if we have been unfair or hasty, the sternest, most reasonable part of us should know to grab the controls and ask whether a revision to our views is likely to be accurate or simply convenient.&nbsp;\nDespite all the pressures we are under to believe otherwise, we should place our faith in the wisdom of a well-worn dictum: trust what you knew then, not what you feel now.",

Someone with prospects and talents starts powerfully but unconsciously to disrupt their lives. They drive away a partner to whom they are otherwise deeply attached. Or they ruin their chances in a demanding professional field to which they could be so well suited.\n\nLucian Freud, Last Portrait, 1976-7\n\nIn our search for answers, we can identify at least four explanations:\n1. Self-Sabotage as a Defence against Omnipotence\nIn the course of ordinary development, every child reaches a curious-sounding stage. They explore what it might be like to be all powerful. Despite their size and limitations, in a mood of manic excitement, they picture themselves as being the absolute ruler of the world, of controlling everything, of killing all their enemies, of triumphing over everyone. They might stand on the kitchen table with a plastic sword and declare themselves to be the king or queen of the universe.\nThis – psychologists tell us – is entirely normal, indeed very healthy. In order to one day achieve a sound relationship between our hopes and our reality, our ambition and our constraints, we all need a chance to befriend our fantasies of complete power and control. We need not to be scared of our own ambitions by having had an opportunity to take their full measure.\nBut how things develop from here depends on the surrounding environment. If parents are balanced and secure in themselves, they will be able to handle their child’s omnipotent moments with a benevolent smile. They can allow time for their expression and then gently and firmly suggest that it might now be time for the king or queen to head upstairs to bed. The omnipotent phase is both permitted and contained, laying the ground for an unfrightened relationship to our expansive self-determined impulses.\nBut not all of us are as fortunate. We may never have been allowed to express the egoism, aggression and triumphalism that have legitimate places inside all of us. The adults in the vicinity may have been so frightened of our potential and so inadequate in themselves, they never allowed us to roar – dooming us to a primitive fear of our strength.\nWe may now find ourselves excessively meak and cowed. We constantly suggest that we wouldn’t hurt a fly. We don’t want to show off in any way. We can’t bear to draw attention to ourselves. We sabotage our intelligence. We turn down opportunities for promotion. We dress in dour clothes. We call ourselves ‘shy.’\nBut this isn’t of course the whole story. Deep down we would love to win, impress, seduce and be admired, we want to tear our enemies to shreds, we would like to be President. But we haven’t been permitted to work out a mature balance between our competing forces. Triumphing in a measured and fruitful way seems to carry too high a price. We must become a mouse because someone took such fright at our first lion-like roars.\n2. Only Failure can Bring Love\nAn associated explanation for self-sabotage lies in parents who subtly send out a perplexing message: only if you fail will you be loved.\nWhile in most households, it’s the successes that are celebrated, in others, parental love seems only available when one is desperate and abject, pathetic and hurt.\nIt’s when one is ill or bullied, rejected and hounded that the unyielding and stern parent seems to melt. What stronger incentive then to make a mess of one’s life than to believe that we might thereby finally secure the parental love that we have always craved?\nWe ruin our chances because – at some level – they don’t feel like chances at all, rather harbingers of loneliness. By succeeding in the world, we feel we may lose the one thing that matters so much to us: the approval of those who put us on the earth.\n3. A Search for Our True Selves\nThere are other households where the message is differently but equally dispiriting. The only route to love is through success. You will be loved, the child is indirectly told, if you win the races, the school prizes and later on the promotions and the titles. We will love you to the extent that you can be important in the eyes of others.\nFor a long time, we might follow the edicts dutifully. But at some point, perhaps when we are on the cusp of winning, there may come a moment of primitive rebellion. A part of us that longed to be loved not for doing but for being, not for achievement but for ourselves, turns against the part of us that has been so good at obedience and line towing.&nbsp;\nWe find ourselves insulting our boss, or failing our exams because we are in protest against the awful sacrifice that we have been forced into. Success doesn’t feel real. Behind our sabotage lies a poignant basic aspiration to be loved authentically. We burn down our worldly achievements in a search for the sincere love we have been owed since the start.\n4. A Desire to Sabotage Someone else\nWe call it self-sabotage but behind the behaviour there might also lie a desire to hurt or sabotage someone else: the parental figure who didn’t love us for who we are, for whom our medals were more important than our defenceless, vulnerable selves.\nAs we ruin our professional chances, it may look as if we are trying to hurt our interests but in fact we may also be trying to upset – even if only in our imaginations – the person who set us on the treadmill of external validation many years before and who will now have nothing left to boast about to the neighbours. As we tear down our pedestal, we are aiming – somewhere inside – to correct an original injustice.\nWe know so much about the appeal of success. We may still be at the dawn of working out how much certain parts of us are – for a range of touching subterranean reasons – so compelled by failure.",

      "text": "We naturally assume that a life in a peaceful country will always be preferable to one in a war torn one. But the history of journalism reveals a more puzzling minor phenomenon: that of the war reporter, a person who willingly and repeatedly places themselves in conflict situations and chooses to exchange a secure base for a home in a stricken zone. In public, the war reporter may explain their motives in geopolitical terms (through their work, they will bring victims’ suffering to world attention or apply pressure on a dictator), but in private, they may admit to more nuanced impulses. They may mention finding war psychologically ‘easier’ than peace, they may describe a wish to submit themselves to threats they simultaneously dread and are enlivened by; the conflicts they keep returning to may be logistically and physically arduous and yet they also spare them the deadness and eeriness they associate with outward harmony, tranquillity and undisturbed afternoons.\n\n\n\nWithout having any of their outward idealism or bravery, some of us may have more of a kinship with these war reporters than we imagine. In our personal lives, in the way we chose to arrange our relationships or govern our careers, we too may be rather more drawn to ‘war’ – conflict, intensity, anxiety, fear and jeopardy – than we are to ‘peace’, understanding, calm, trust, love and ease.\nIn our relationships, we may gravitate towards difficult characters around whom giving and receiving affection will be fraught. We may never be more in our element than in the company of an avoidant personality who isn’t sure they want to be involved with us or who has trouble regulating their moods or communicating their intentions. When we are introduced to more mature resolved characters, we may appreciate their kindness, composure and openness of heart. But nor can we deny an uncomfortable emotion as we walk away from our rendez-vous in the cafe: fateful boredom.&nbsp;\nIn our professional lives too, we may drive ourselves towards periods of crisis, engineering tough deadlines and threats from creditors. We may never feel more alive than when matters edge towards catastrophe.&nbsp;\nTo explain our proclivities, we need to look backwards. We are likely to have grown up in conflict zones – not involving guns and grenades, but parents who shouted or drank, hit or bullied, childhoods of drama, fear and humiliation.\nIt may not have been pleasant, but our whole personalities were shaped to cope. The past taught us to be hypervigilant, to scan the room, to sleep very lightly, to trust no one and to expect the worst. And this is why we are now allergic to the calm we claim to long for. We prefer shouting to tender whispers. We are more unnerved by kindness than withheld affection. When there is only good news, we wonder with mounting intensity what horror is about to be unleashed. In the end, we may simply find peace too arduous; we prefer to destroy the happy relationship, blow up the business and seek out pain before it finds us of its own accord.\nIt may be too ambitious to hope for a wholesale transformation in our natures. We may not be able to get the war reporter inside us, a veteran of years in the Mekong Delta or the Bekaa valley, to adjust to life in a placid suburb of Zurich or Birmingham.&nbsp;\nBut we may hope for greater ease by at least acknowledging our paradoxes. Whatever we may state about seeking contented love or workplace stability, we should darkly accept that we are not made for such luxuries. Once we can square up to the war reporter inside us, we may learn to live as sensibly as we can within the boundaries of our follies. We might, as it were, buy the best flak jackets and travel in marked convoys. And when we next find ourselves in turmoil, we should remind ourselves that there is a central part of us that very much wanted to keep an appointment here.\nBut perhaps once we have fully accepted our dread of calm and harmony, we may eventually surprise ourselves with an occasional pleasure at a day that unfolds without crisis or tolerate a new partner who seems only to want to be kind to us. We may yet lose some of the terrors of peace.",

      "text": "It is tempting to assume that one might simply be born either introverted or extroverted, as though these categories were biological in nature, a little like eye or hair colour. But a more likely explanation is that we in fact become introverted or extroverted as a result of particular experiences; it is our distinctive path through childhood that determines at which end of the social and temperamental spectrum we are going to fall.\n\nVincenzo Foppa, Young Cicero Reading, 1515\n\nOne might propose that introverts tend to be people who have, first and foremost, had to attune themselves too powerfully and too early to the needs of those looking after them. From a young age, they will have had to ask themselves implicitly: ‘What do the somewhat unstable, alarming or difficult people around me require of me?’ As opposed to being able to think, with greater authenticity and freedom, as small children always should: ‘What do I want? How do I feel? What do I have to say?’\nPerhaps there was a fragile mother who couldn’t cope with any demands, who wanted to be humoured and looked after – and who was, in middle age, still deep down a child herself. Or perhaps there was a father with an extremely volatile temper who needed to be watched very carefully, and cheered and distracted to prevent recurrences of rage.\nThe future introvert is liable to have succeeded brilliantly at their vigilant tasks. They will have grown up to be experts at working out how to manage difficult characters and give them what they need. But this talent will not have been without a very high cost to their own natures.\nIf we are highly attuned to everyone we meet, if we can’t help but automatically mollify and appease the moods of others, we’re going to end up finding company extremely exhausting.\nWe’ll have far more of a need than some to spend time on our own, because company will make so much more of an impression on us, it will stimulate our nerves, it will constantly call from us soothing and containing responses that, however effective these might be, cut us off from our true selves. We will crave to be alone because being together takes us so far from who we really are.&nbsp;\nIntroverts lack an experience that they could be with others and have their needs met. Their history has taught them that the only person who could possibly understand their needs is them.&nbsp;\nAll this can make relationships especially hard for introverts. They may be brilliant at understanding the needs of their partner. But they will also, after a while, experience an overwhelming wish to be by themselves and resent their partner’s comparatively strong desire for connection and contact, because they operate with a binary perspective on the fulfilment of needs: it will be them or me. But never both.&nbsp;\nFrom this we can start to see an ideal evolution for the introvert. That they should cease to make such a sharp distinction between what might happen to their needs in company and what can happen when they are alone. They would ideally understand their own pessimism as to what relationships entail – and cease to approach every encounter with a new person with the assumption that they will merely need to accommodate someone else. They might not have to assume that solitude would be the only route to an authentic audience.\nThey might learn a simple lesson that their difficult past will have unfairly cut them off from: that a relationship worthy of the term is one that gracefully allows two people to be heard and seen in tandem.",

      "text": "Some of us appear to have an above average talent for finding ourselves in unfulfilling relationships. Our unions might begin with a lot of hope – but in time, problems set in: a lack of affection, an absence of intimacy, an emotional chill, affairs. \nWhen these issues rear their heads, most of us would know to think that – however lovely the start might have been – it is time to leave. And fairly fast. Someone who has messed us around as the partner has, or been as cold, or as sadistic, does not deserve a second or indeed any chance.\n\nWalter Sickert, The Rose Shoe, c. 1906\n\nBut for others of us, this is when we begin to show our distinctive colours. Hope springs eternal. Yes, the partner may presently be somewhat disappointing but soon they may recover. Admittedly, they have become hugely unkind in many ways, but they apologised nicely last week (before repeating their offence) and so there is a decent chance – we believe – that things will be on an upswing over the longer term.\nTo outside observers, the faith that we have in our partner can appear quasi religious. Why do we keep giving our unreliable companion so much leeway? Why do we hope against hope? Why don’t we cut our losses right now and leave? Why are we so convinced that with just a little more effort on our part, one more discussion, one more long email sent in the early hours, everything will alter? Furthermore, perhaps, why do we keep assuming that we have done something wrong and that it is primarily our role to apologise and make amends?\nThe explanation is that we grew into hopeful people not by choice but of necessity. We almost certainly spent our childhoods in circumstances where we had no option but to become enormous believers in our parents – and, simultaneously, enormous doubters of ourselves.\nWhen little, we could not afford to think that our parents were simply disappointing wounded people with whom we should not interact too much – and walk away. We were four years old. So we did what children of unfulfilling parents always do. We started to think ill of ourselves, we developed a genius for wondering what was wrong with us and for assembling complicated and overly generous explanations for the bad behaviour of others. We evolved an expectant stance towards whatever morsel of love our parent might throw our way; we became excited by deprivation. All day they might have been ill-tempered and cruel to us; perhaps at night fall, they might say something sweet and ruffle our hair. This became the most exciting (and appalling) ‘game’ of our lives.\nAs adults, we continue to be addicted to this tension. It has come to seem that this is what love is: the pain-tinged continuous expectation that an unfulfilling person might abruptly turn around and be nice to us again. Love is waiting for someone who was once slightly kind to resume their interest.\nIt doesn’t strike us that love might actually be something quite different, simpler and less tortured: an ongoing reliable exchange of mutually respectful sympathy and gentleness. And if is not this, that we should leave at once. Indeed, if we have the troubled fortune to meet a reliable soul, we will probably respond to them with a feeling of nausea and bewilderment – and flee in short order (perhaps back to the last unfulfilling partner). \nThe toll we pay in terms of wasted years is lamentable. Whereas others among us can enjoy calm, kindly relationships, we will get locked into exhausting scenarios with perturbed individuals who very subtly mess us around, who say one thing and do another, who don’t give us physical affection or blow hot and cold, who may be having affairs and keep promising to change and don’t. And the worst is that, for all our suffering, this somehow excites us, this keeps us on our toes, this feels like what we need to keep doing. We know nothing else.\nWe have to start to believe what our childhoods never allowed us to think: some people need to be given up on, certain seemingly ordinary and good people are in fact very damaged and will hurt and bully those around them. Some people with a few lovely qualities to them will, considered in the round, work an entirely negative effect on our lives.\nIt’s not our role to keep second guessing unfulfilling people; to spin elaborate stories as to why they may be doing what they do. We don’t need to think more about their psychology than they care to. We need to look very closely at what they do, not why they might be as they are.&nbsp;\nAnd conversely, despite our nausea, we don’t need to keep holding it against certain others that they are kind. There is nothing wrong with them for being sweet, there is something very sad about our past that we are so easily sickened by their manner.\nIf this sounds like us, we urgently need to tell ourselves that the person who has maltreated or is maltreating us will never change. Our boundless hope that they might is not rooted in any reality, it’s the legacy of a childhood which obliged us to keep faith with people who no free person should ever have had to keep faith with. There is one and only one criterion that determines whether we should be with someone: whether or not they are kind to us. If they were but are no longer, we need to leave. If they are only a small percentage of the time, we need to leave. If they show a promise of kindness, but no delivery, we need to leave. We need to break our addiction to a suffering that we were not owed then – and definitely don’t deserve now.",

      "text": "A dark and frightening way to predict what might happen in your relationship with a new person is to ask them what happened to them in their childhood.\n\nFrancisco de Goya, Detail from The Duke and Duchess of Osuna and their Children, 1788\n\nOften, we stand to hear a sad and sombre tale, in which our partner was cast in the role of a victim (as children typically are). For example:\n— At a young age, their parents turned against your partner and diverted their attention to a younger sibling. They became deaf to their calls for attention and treated them unreliably – and then denied that they had done so, scrambling the poor child’s sense of reality.\nOr:\n— Their parents didn’t give them warmth and care and left them feeling that there was something wrong with them for wanting love.\nOr:\n— Their parents humiliated them for not being ‘good enough’, perhaps not sufficiently cultured or sporty, sociable or tidy.\nIn the early days, we are liable to be extremely sympathetic to these stories. Our heart reaches out to the younger version of our companion, whom we would have wanted to hug tightly and reassure.\nHowever, it can be a long time – as many as three to four years – before something more alarming comes into view, which we very often aren’t able to analyse or interpret, let alone prevent. Our partner may (unconsciously) start to enact in our relationship the very same dynamic as they experienced in their childhood – but with one key difference. This time, they are in the role of the perpetrator and we (unwittingly) are cast in the role of their victim.\nSo for example:\n— Our partner may mysteriously cool on us, and begin to get highly attached to a friend or a colleague. When we complain and ask for their love back, they pretend that we are ‘imagining’ that they are being distant or unreliable, leaving us puzzled as to what might be unfolding.\nOr:\n— Our partner may withdraw from us emotionally and sexually, leaving us knocking at the castle door, hoping to be let back in.\nOr:\n— Our partner may start to become snide and mocking about our apparent insufficiencies, calling us uncreative or uncultured, which had never appeared to bother them before.\nWhat on earth is going on? The explanation may run like this. In the deep minds of our partner, it appears that there are really only two positions that one can adopt in a relationship. Either one is the perpetrator. Or one is the victim. This is – after all – exactly what their childhood taught them. And in the choice between these two, rather naturally, our partner has decided to adopt the exclusively safe stance that their parents once enjoyed, the perpetrator role, and then cast us as their victim. We must suffer in the way they did – for only then can they feel (in the recesses of their psyches) that they are not going to be tormented all over again. \nThe way out of this horrific possibility is to become hugely aware of it, to bring it into circulation in the couple and to search for evidence of it in oneself and the other. More profoundly, the task is to start to see that – unlike what childhood may have taught – there is in fact very much one central and redeeming alternative available to being a victim or a perpetrator. There is a role that – tragically – no one showed a child as their mind was forming but that is true goal of all genuine loving relationships: that of being the nurturer, the one who heals, who offers, who comforts and who cares, the one we are all craving to have and, in our healthier moments, are all longing to be.",

The enquiry ‘Don’t you trust me?’ – raised by an old friend or a lover at a moment of crisis – is always meant to shame us into emitting a powerful ‘yes’. To know how to trust other humans is to affirm our fundamental decency and legitimate place in the community.\nBut whatever the rhetorical force of this stance, some of us need to admit to a far more uncomfortable and far more complicated reality. If we look at the matter squarely, if we can bear to be honest with ourselves, then we have to make a fundamental admission: in truth, we don’t trust anyone. Not now or ever. We are continually on our guard. Our alarm is always on – even around our closest friends and lovers. We are perpetually looking out for the exit routes. We are always anticipating an attack. \n\nPhoto by Markus Spiske on Unsplash\n\nThis is not a piece of news that the world is generally remotely ready to hear and untrusting people know to stay quiet, apprehending that their stance can put them at severe risk of becoming objects of distrust.\nBut rather than assuming that trust must be a given, we should see it instead as the slow fruit of a reliable, loving past – which we may just not have had. Instead of blaming ourselves for our entrenched suspicions, we should accept that trust was naturally not going to be possible for us, given the conditions we grew up in. Why would we ever trust anyone with the parents or siblings or trajectory we had? Why would it be remotely easy to let ourselves go around adult partners if, in the vulnerability of early childhood, we were continually humiliated or belittled? Our distrust is the natural and inevitable result of an early history of betrayal and difficulty.\nHow logical too that we now seek out partners who will let us down, thereby confirming the reassuringly sombre story that others cannot be relied upon. Or that we blow up relationships with kind, good people, in order to be spared the agonies of uncertain hope.\nThe route out of manic distrust begins with a confession: ‘I don’t actually trust you at the moment. But I would love to.’ If someone can bear our present distrust, they may – paradoxically – be the very sort of people whom we might one day come to have faith in.\nIf we push ourselves too hard, if we assume that we must trust already in order to be human or kind, we will never overcome our condition. We need to accept that trust is an achievement and – for very understandable reasons – not one we have yet been able to master.",

But what if we land on no one better? Yet what if we stay and the relationship never improves? Should we buy this property that’s beautiful but worryingly close to the railway tracks? Or should we buy the other one that has less charm but might be quieter? Should we accept this job that has prestige and the possibility of a stellar future? Or should we stay where we are because we love our colleagues and have a high quality of life?\n\nVincent van Gogh, Road with Cypress and Star, 1890\n\nPart of the agony of choosing at such moments is that we are in the background consumed by the idea that the ‘wrong choice’ may prove appalling in the extreme and the right choice a route to exceptional fulfilment.&nbsp;\nBut we are perhaps suffering unnecessarily and might find reassurance in the strategic use of two kinds of thinking, alternately optimistic and pessimistic in tone. To trial the former, we might propose that part of the reason why certain choices feel so hard is that all options on the table have – in truth – something to offer us. The choice is only ‘hard’ because we are having to pick between substantially decent alternatives. We cannot choose because the choices before us all have a lot to offer us. If we stayed with X, there would be much to celebrate. And if we went off and found someone else, they would have many charms too. As for the two homes we are judging between, both are really very pleasant in different ways. And the same holds true for our jobs. Whichever option we choose, we will have much to be pleased about.\nThere is equal comfort to be found by running the argument in a pessimistic direction. We are obsessed by the idea that a wise choice will help to prevent a nightmare, but considered soberly, there will be something pretty difficult about every route we take. We are finding it hard to choose because all options have their unavoidably disappointing dimensions. X partner can certainly be annoying; but so will Y partner. Pretty much anyone we end up with is going to have their dispiriting sides. There is no dodging the inherent difficulty of everyone. As for property, no house can ever make life perfect. A lot of unhappiness will be ours wherever we happen to sleep. No house can spare us certain fundamental agonies of existence. Similarly, the dissatisfactions we know in our present job will have equivalents whatever job we pick. In other words, everything is certain to be a bit awful – a truth we are vainly striving to deny in our furious search for the ‘right choice’.\nWhat powers the pain of choice is to a large extent an illusion: the idea of a single solution that can either conclusively deliver happiness or skirt unhappiness. We are exaggerating our agency. Once we recognise that by the time we are spending hours on a choice, anything we choose will be both pretty fine and simultaneously stubbornly somewhat awful too, we may cease to grow either quite so exercised or so terrified. We can afford to rest more easily. We are never far from pain; and we are never far from joy. We might let a roll of the dice decide the rest.",

      "text": "There is a particular kind of pain that some of us have to endure at the end of a relationship stemming from the confusing way in which we both had to call time on the union – and resolutely didn’t want to. Not only are we bereft of the relationship we cherished, we have to carry the guilt of being the ones who ‘ended it’ while having no ostensible wish to have done so. We wind up worrying we did the ‘wrong thing’ and caused someone else avoidable suffering while not perceiving the underlying truth: &#8216;we&#8217; didn’t end anything.\nIt is important to be able to soften our pain by untangling the logic and stating a fundamental principle. The one who ends a relationship is not necessarily the one who calls for a serious chat and says it’s over. This is merely the one who declares a relationship finished – a very different thing. The one who actually ends the relationship is the one who ceases to love. And unfortunately, the one who ceases to love often does so in very unobtrusive and hard-to-pin-down ways which they don’t discuss and which the other party has to constantly doubt whether they are imagining or not. For example, by being there and yet not quite being there. By being cold but denying they are so. By being repeatedly grouchy but dissimulating their lack of engagement by counter charges of unreasonableness or neediness. By privileging their friends and then saying that the partner is possessive.\n\nÉmile Friant, Cast Shadows, 1891\n\nThe result is that one partner can be sternly calling for an end while deep down longing for the other to simply be more responsive and engaged; the ending is just the last move to be free of pain once every other attempt to get love back on the road appears to have failed. It definitely isn’t the first or the hundredth choice. And the other party may ostensibly be calling for a relationship to continue – while secretly (and we may need to say unconsciously) manoeuvring for the partner to have no other recourse but to end it.\nThe level of unconsciousness in all this can be debated. If we are being squeamish and generous, we could say that the rejecting partner doesn’t know anything about their desire to be free of the relationship at all. But we might not be giving human nature its full due if we didn’t imagine that at times, they know only too well. It’s just so very much easier to let another person do the painful work for one.\nWhatever is at play, the avoidant partner evidently cannot cleanly admit to their level of ambivalence. When asked ‘do you want this to continue?’ their answer is always ‘yes’. But when the relationship is given a chance to flourish, they do nothing to help it do so. They may on a Monday be saying the relationship should have another chance and by Wednesday be once more subtly pulling away by not answering calls or replying in a gruff and distracted way.\nThis is why the break up may need to happen a few times. Just so that the one who ends it can get a full sense that it isn’t they who are actually ending it each time. This unfortunate being can end up regretting ‘what they did’ while forgetting a stranger truth: they didn’t do anything. They may go back and try to correct ‘their decision’ (and the ex may even let them) before the complicated reality sets in: it wasn’t their decision in the first place and, as one or two or three more goes at love will show them, they aren’t going to be able to change the eventual outcome whatever they try.\nSo for some of us, there seems no alternative but to have to end relationships with an extra burden of grief. We will be publicly identified as the one who broke up. We will have to carry the blame and the shame. Others may judge us. And the one who has supposedly been left will in some quarters be able to get a lot of sympathy for their ‘abandonment.’\nAnd yet the story isn’t true. Deep down, we would have loved for the relationship to continue. We might have have done a lot to help it do so. But we couldn’t accept a dead or half-hearted connection – without genuine love, or effort or intimacy. We ended it because what was on offer didn’t feel to us like a relationship any more – even if it is always going to lie in the partner’s prerogative to claim otherwise.\nWe may just have to accept a complicated truth: we had to call time on the relationship – but we didn’t end it. We were holding the axe when it fell, but we never picked it up. We walked away not because we were not in love, but because we were.",

After all, we’re pretty good at housework; they leave crockery and towels in the wrong places. We love to talk; they’re often too tired. We remember their birthdays; they’ve twice forgotten ours. \n\nPaul Cezanne, The Black Marble Clock, c. 1869-71\n\nWe can wind up feeling that, insofar as our relationship will ever improve, they have to be the ones to change. We’ve done everything we can. We just have to cross our arms and wait for them to see the light.\nOur stance may be logically impeccable – but it isn’t, for that matter, especially on point if what we’re trying to do is continue to have a relationship. Being strictly ‘right’ all the time has its deep satisfactions; but they generally have to be enjoyed singly.\nIn reality, wherever the faults may have started, there is a great deal we might do to improve the dynamics of our love. We don’t have to wait passively for our ‘opponent’ to come to a full realisation of their intricately erroneous ways. We have the power to change the collective weather right now even if it is they who may have darkened it in places.&nbsp;\nA shift can begin by a small, always surprising reminder of an essential truth: that we too are in areas distinctly monstrous, appalling and mistaken. Not necessarily in the very areas our partner is, but somewhere and for a very basic reason: because we are human. Folly, sinfulness, mania and blindness are not randomly scattered problems, they are the basic lot of every creature who has ever walked the earth.&nbsp;\nTherefore, though they have undoubtedly messed up in ways, and though we may have written very lengthy manuals (in our minds) about where exactly their errors lie, we are in the end and by necessity equally dishevelled and flawed. We too are idiotic and vain, blinkered and proud; we too need a lot of charity to be endured.\nSuch background pessimism may not directly solve our problems, but it can help hugely to dissipate the mood that entrenches the worst of our conflicts. Once we know we’re not facing a uniquely misfiring human, only another version of our own broken selves, we can abandon once and for all the delicious yet ruinous sense that there is only one mad person in the couple. By definition, by an ineluctable law of nature, there are always two wholly insane blockheads, in the sense of beings heavily afflicted by irrational forces dating from their childhoods, unable to see important truths about themselves, subject to an array of over-intense fears and defensive patterns of behaviour and needing much courage and love to be tolerated. To know ourselves better should be to want to say ‘sorry’ to pretty much everyone who has ever crossed our paths.\nFurthermore, of course, at points we want them dead and wouldn’t mind if the pavement opened up to swallow them. But we have the self-righteousness of people who have never properly thought through what loss would entail. Our critical nature bears the imprint of an implicit belief in the partner’s permanence. But if we properly picture their heart attack on the way home or the letter declaring their wish to go off with someone else, a very different set of emotions would likely come to the fore. We’d bargain with the universe to have them back, we wouldn’t for a second care that they failed to listen to our anecdote about their mother and bought the wrong jam three times in a row. We forget the extent of our love because we have lost sight of their impermanence; we are ill-tempered because we are ignoring that we are all going to die.&nbsp;\nNone of this is to deny the serious pleasures of feeling certain that the other is to blame; just to insist on an even greater satisfaction that lies to hand: that of reconnecting with the love that still far outstrips our disappointment and anger.",

      "text": "Some of us have a distinctive attitude to red flags in relationships. We can certainly see &#8211; if we push ourselves &#8211; that certain flags might exist in a prospective or actual partner. We might notice an absence of good communication, a failure to respect boundaries, an emotional reactivity, certain moments of deceitfulness, a people pleasing evasiveness… Yet what makes us special is what we choose to do next. And that is: strictly nothing.\nWe carry on deepening the relationship, and perhaps building an entire life with the person, because our red flag faculty is uncommonly limp and atrophied. Why has this vital muscle been neglected? We can put it like this: the ability to respond actively to red flags depends on having had a certain sort of childhood.\nImagine that we were born into a family where there was a father who bullied, a mother who betrayed us and an older brother who was tyrannical; a family where lies were the norm and where bad behaviour was meticulously swept under the carpet. How useful would it have been to keep an active eye out for ‘red flags’ in this sort of context? What could we have done if we had spotted one or ten or three thousand such flags? Taken the news to the police, alerted our friends, confronted our perpetrators? We might have been three-and-a-half years old at the time. Our survival depended precisely on not seeing, or interpreting as our fault, whatever problematic dynamics might have existed.\nWhat’s more &#8211; and more complicatedly &#8211; we may have deeply loved the people who were draped in red. We simultaneously minded what our caregivers were doing to us and adored them. They might have been hugely mean to us at points but we instinctively chose to focus on the nice moments (the holidays by the sea, the bicycle we received). We were never going to make such a big deal about the rest. Insofar as they neglected and humiliated us, we must have been to blame. Humans spot as many red flags as they can bear to see.\n\nEdward Hopper, Room in New York, 1932\n\nWith such a past behind us, we’re not going to be the first to get incensed at hints of a problematic side or two in our partners. If someone tells us they love us, this is pretty much all we need to assume that things are going to be good enough. Why focus on the downsides? That they keep talking about who else they find attractive? That they seem rather good at getting us to pay for things? That they don’t quite show up on time, ever? That they haven’t introduced us to any of their friends? That they don’t appear to have a job or any active plans to get one?\nOf course these things bother us a bit. But they also bring on a kind of sleepiness. We can’t rise to the occasion that their discovery should demand. We know they are there; we prefer to think about something else.\nIn order to be a serious red flag watcher, we need to have grown up with an impression that our happiness, safety and well-being were supremely important matters for someone else &#8211; whom we subsequently learnt to copy in our treatment of ourselves. We need to have an original feeling that we will not let people handle us badly, that there can be nothing justified about being taken for a ride and that if we are lied to, the fault lies firmly with the liar.&nbsp;\nThe first step towards change is to notice our peculiarity. However intelligent we may be in some areas, in relationships, we are suffering from an intense selective narcolepsy. We have no appetite to perceive problems; for we were never loved enough to feel that we deserved not to have them.&nbsp;\nWe need to start asking ourselves some remarkably naive sounding questions: are we being handled well? Do we agree with what is happening to us? Do we dare to complain? Are we happy?\nFor most of us, these are obvious and natural questions. For a minority, they signal the birth of a truly significant new capacity to think more carefully and with more tenderness about our own welfare.",

      "text": "We might assume that our great longing in relationships would be to be looked after by someone; an exceptionally kind person who could listen to us, nurture us, assist us and make us feel comforted and seen.&nbsp;\nBut this is to ignore just how strong there is &#8211; in some of us &#8211; a diametrically opposed aspiration: a wish to find someone who is in a lot of pain and trouble, who is confused and sad, unhappy and overwhelmed, and who cannot therefore possibly do very much for us, but who we, on the other hand, have every opportunity to hold, appease, calm, and heal.&nbsp;\n\nEdvard Munch, On the Waves of Love, 1896, Wikimedia Commons\n\nFor this group among us, troubles aren’t just nuisances to be managed, they lie at the core of what we positively desire to find in others. We feel our heart tighten when we learn that someone had a difficult childhood, or is isolated and adrift or has been bullied at work or made to feel worthless in a past relationship. These are not merely regrettable incidentals, they lie at the centre of our feelings of love.\nFor us to be this way, there tends to have been a certain sort of childhood. Something has happened to us early on which means that giving assistance has become decisively easier than receiving it.\nWe might say that everyone, at the start, longs to receive love. But when it has not been especially forthcoming, one way to handle its absence is to turn into a compulsive caregiver; to offer others what we wish could have been offered to us, to turn our deficiency into a bounty, to locate the needy part of us in someone else and then to heal it in them as an alternative to addressing it in ourselves.\nWhen we have had to forego our wish to be nurtured and understood &#8211; because mum was elsewhere or dad low in spirits &#8211; we might have begun by looking after our teddy bear, then moved on to friends, and eventually in adulthood, discovered our greatest satisfaction in salving the woes of our lovers.&nbsp;\nWe may now be rendered hugely uncomfortable whenever the tables turn even for a moment. If a lover said, ‘tonight it’s going to be all about you,’ we would flinch. To hear ‘I want to put you at the centre of my world’ could bring on panic.\nIt’s not that such care isn’t fundamentally wanted, it’s that it was never experienced and so has grown alien and frightening, a reminder of a wound we haven’t been strong enough to contemplate, rage at and move on from.&nbsp;\nThe way out of our cul-de-sac is to start to notice how scared we are. We may have justified our behaviour by thinking of ourselves principally as selfless. But we are something more complicated and more interesting: terrified. We aren’t just without reciprocity, we are manically intolerant of it. And yet, as we still stand to discover, sometimes, the real generosity is to let a lover do to us what a parent did not at the start. It’s to stop occupying the powerful position of the rescuer and learn, at points, to take the risk of being at another’s mercy. It’s to experience &#8211; as if for the first time &#8211; how much we need someone else. Real maturity may be as much about a capacity to receive as to give.",

      "text": "Many of us are prone to slip into states of mind we might call ‘manic’ – in which we run obsessively and at high speed away from something within us that asks for our attention and yet feels intolerably raw and overwhelming.\n\nEgon Schiele, Self-Portrait with Outstretched Arms, 1911\n\nThere are many ways in which we might ‘run’ away. We may keep extremely busy; ensuring that there is not a single moment in the day left to pause and acknowledge our feelings, creating a life in which external demands are perpetual and unrelenting. In this, the modern world is supremely cooperative, prioritising continuous economic activity over stillness and interior awareness – and lending enormous implicit prestige to the art of never being with oneself.\nWe may also deploy fear and anxiety in the service of self-forgetting. We may be masters at choreographing one panic after another so as to block insight. On Monday, we may lose connection with most of our minds over an email, by Tuesday, we are alarmed about the possible response of a friend, Wednesday sees us scared about something we told a colleague and on and on. We tell ourselves that we have no alternative to fear, but in truth, we are turning our whole lives into a white water rafting experience, pretending that we are facing one mortal enemy after another, as a way to sidestep an exploration of feelings of regret and dislocation.\nOr our mania may push us towards addictive behaviours: alcohol and drugs most commonly but it might also be pornography, exercise or repeated checks of our phones.\nWhat unites our manic states is that they involve a febrile wish to avoid an acknowledgement of, and reckoning with our minds and their feelings of loss, sadness and isolation. We are usually – beneath the storms of anxiety, busy-ness or lust – primarily bereft and unreconciled to pain. But we are refusing the work of mourning. We cannot bear to feel the feelings that are our due. We prefer to press ourselves against a narrow ledge in our minds rather than stepping down to explore their wider, quieter, sadder open spaces.\nThe task is to lessen our fear of our own unwellness. The world isn’t so terrifying, we are using terror not to feel our loneliness. There isn’t so much to do, we are deploying busy-ness to stop ourselves encountering our loss and confusion.\nWe need to make friends with the root causes of our griefs in order not to continue to suffer from the manic symptoms of their denial. We need to lie quietly by ourselves and dare to finally and fully listen to some of the very sad things inside us that we have half known about for so long.",

Our early childhoods may not have lent us any secure sense that love could be relied upon. Perhaps our father left the family shortly before our fifth birthday to live on the other side of the world. Perhaps our mother was humiliating and cold. Or maybe our parents struggled with addictions.\nAs a result, we developed techniques to ensure that we would always remain alone and isolated – and therefore safe from disappointment and further injury. We may well crave affection. We may have elaborate daydreams of what we would like our relationships to be like. We may be wholly sincere when we profess that we want to give ourselves to someone open and responsive. It’s just that alongside such readiness, we are also keen to ensure that we will never, ever be in a position where love might properly flourish, where we could be deeply happy alongside someone, and then – for reasons outside of our control – love could disappear as suddenly and as horrifically as it once did. We opt for the frustrations and slow despair of unfulfilled love over the unstable terrors of reciprocal ecstasy.\nThis helps to explain the sort of people we may be drawn to: lovers who marry us but then withdraw inwardly. Lovers who are always half in and half out and who play elaborate games of push and pull. We may complain heartily about their ‘coldness’ but how carefully and determinedly we have sought it out.\nWe begin to heal the moment we start to suspect that we are not just randomly unlucky, we are engaged in patterns of self-sabotage; we are carefully sidling up to those who are going to keep us at bay – and we are doing this in a misguided but understandable attempt to keep us safe in the wake of the difficulties of our childhoods.\nIt might take some of us the greater part of our lives until we no longer hold it against someone that they can warmly adore us.",

      "text": "For all the songs and poems and novels written in its honour, the sickness of heartbreak is unlikely to strike most of us more than a few times in our lives – at least in its most severe form. It’s therefore a disease that is both enormously consequential and which we’re unlikely to be properly prepared for in terms of grasping its duration, effects and likely trajectory. We would do well to equip ourselves as if for some extremely potent and near-fatal viral affliction.\n\nFelix Vallotton, The Provincial, 1909\n\nThe first and central ingredient of the most calamitous heartbreaks is – of course – a deeply lovely person. Monsters, cads, reprobates and double-dealers may naturally graze our hearts, but the only ones who can truly pulverise them are, by definition, the extreme sweeties. The ones who nearly kill us are the very same ones who, months or years before, gave us a tender and shy first kiss, who lent us adorable nicknames, remembered our quirks, were endeared by our flaws, forgave us our anxieties, solved our problems and held us closely through nights of pain and alarm, reassuring us that they would never, ever leave us. These are the ones who – without us having any clue at the time – were preparing us for one of the most severe blows of our lives.\nThe next essential ingredient for agony is a very slow, ambiguous and delicately phrased departure. Not for these sweeties the generosity of the brutal lover who will say (with immense underlying kindness): ‘I’ve had enough, you bore me and I’ve met someone else.’ These unwitting tormentors continue to profess love, they say they miss us even when they have departed, they may be giving us birthday presents and coming around months after they first hesitantly explained that ‘in some ways’ they might ‘perhaps’ ‘in a way’ need ‘a little space’. Eventually, in the very worst of cases, we may have to end the relationship for them because they are simply too sensitive to do it themselves.\nThereafter, we’re left with the 3 a.m. questions: what’s wrong with us? When did they first start to plan this? What does another lover have that we don’t? Where did we go wrong? These are going to be among the worst speculations of our lives – and if we can recognise them as such, our pain does not need to feel quite so persecutory. Needless to say, we can’t and shouldn’t ever try to answer; such questions belong among the great mysteries. We don’t fully know why love begins; and shouldn’t ever probe too much as to why it has ended.\nThe bore is that it all has to take up so much time. There can’t be any quick escapes from our devotion. It takes an age to stop believing in someone. We have to go over every single memory multiple times. We have to convert what would initially have seemed like a freak eventuality of fate into a non-negotiable necessity. We have to establish that this month had to be our last, that we wouldn’t travel abroad together, that they would go to that party and meet someone else, that contingency was – after all – a wholehearted necessity. \nIn wise cultures, bereaved people are directed to wear special clothing and given licence to wail openly. No one expects them to be balanced for a very long time. Much the same should be permitted of the heartbroken. Someone has died here too; a version of ourselves that was the sweetheart’s little bean, that wrapped up their presents and stayed up late to support them with their projects, that believed them when they said they wanted it to be forever and had never felt this way about anyone else before. This poor version of ourselves has been knifed and must be laid to rest, flowers laid at their grave and a team of mourners sent to sing hymns to their memory.&nbsp;\nWe should not try to be brave. This has to count among the greatest griefs of our lives. We should lose our confidence entirely, we should yearn to call them up and beg limitlessly, we should lose our dignity over them, we should be certain that we’ll never overcome this, we should hate them and love them simultaneously, we should check our phones a hundred times for signs of life from them, we should bore our best friends senseless with our repetitive agonies.&nbsp;\nOnly thereby can we give the love we had for them proper stature – and begin to let it go. We might need six months to process five good years. Miraculous though this now seems, one day we’ll be able to say their name and feel next to nothing besides a little boredom. One day we’ll be of the view that they were the ones who made a mistake. One day we’ll be firmly on our own side – and we’ll be free.",

      "text": "Our societies have become hugely more respectful of, and sensitive to, mental illness than any of their predecessors. We now know how to behave with patience when someone tells us that their mental health is suffering or when a colleague is granted time off work to address issues in their minds.\nBut this surface sympathy does not necessarily mean that it is natively easy for most us to understand what might really be going in states of mental ill health. We can be tempted – despite ourselves, deep down – to suspect that a sufferer may simply be exaggerating or malingering. Or we may feel that a sufferer has gone to a place lacking any connection whatsoever to anything we can know, imagine or relate to: they are (though we would never use the term) ‘mad’ or ‘insane’, conditions we are in no place to start to picture in any easy or intimate way.\n\nWassily Kandinsky, Fragments, 1943\n\nSo it can help to propose that most states of unwellness are not radically different from those occasionally and briefly experienced by all of us; they are simply much, much more extreme. Mental illness draws on all the challenges faced by an ordinary mind, and then exaggerates them exponentially. A mentally ill person is you without any brakes, you without any dampeners, you without any ability to change the subject, adopt a different angle or be refreshed by sleep. Being ill is less about what one is feeling and thinking as what one is no longer able to think or feel: within illness, there are no more counter arguments available, there is no reassurance, there is no more space between panics. There are simply undiluted doses of unworthiness, terror, suspicion, guilt and self-loathing.\nAn unwell person may – for example – become convinced that they have done a terrible thing, that everyone will hate them, that the end is coming soon. Kindly well-wishers will offer ordinary reassurance: it’s bound to be fine, nothing terrible is on the cards, it’s going to be OK… One might expect a crisis to be over in a few minutes. But the mind of the sufferer cannot achieve a benevolent perspective. Pure fear starts to course through their veins and brooks no opposition. They can no longer eat, or walk. Their shoulders stoop, they take to bed and weep. The next seemingly logical thought is that they must die – and that the world would be infinitely better off without them.\nOr else a sufferer can become convinced that they are a bad person. It’s a common enough thought but again, the illness is identified by its extremity, not by its basic content. They aren’t in their eyes just a little flawed, they are fundamentally repulsive, they are entirely unworthy, they should never have been born. There is no room for forgiveness or allowance for humanity. When the illness is especially severe, a voice may tell the poor soul at every moment that everything they are and do and have ever achieved is a catastrophe. A state of mind that could in others be momentary invades their whole cognitive apparatus.\nMental illness afflicts people who are in many other moments of their lives competent, vigorous, kind and hugely joyous. It descends in an instant – set off by what could seem like a relatively innocuous setback (a challenge in love, a slightly threatening email, a small rumour etc). Like falling through the ice, one minute one is on the surface (and may have been there for months), the next one is in the freezing waters and in the gravest kind of trouble.\nWe should be educated not just to know that there is such a thing as mental illness but helped to feel what it might be like and to shudder at the connections between the states of mind we know already and those that are involved in a crisis.\nThereafter, we should be ready to give the mentally unwell what they most need: time to recover, immense love and sympathy while they do so and trust that they are not malingering. People have been mentally unwell since the beginning of our species. It is a major achievement of our era that we – the well and the not so well – are slowly starting to grasp what might be at play in one of the very worst and unfortunately most real diseases to which any of our organs is prone.",

      "text": "Our societies are attached to a phrase which it can be a bit too easy to assume we understand. The talk is of people ‘growing’ and of having ‘grown’ which alludes to some kind of important psychological evolution and development. But what does ‘growing’ really involve? What is it we are developing a capacity to do when we so-called grow and what are we leaving behind? And, crucially, how might we train ourselves to grow a little more – and a little more quickly?\n\nIthell Colquhoun, Anthurium, 1936\n\nWhat we may essentially be pointing to with the idea of growth is the ability to stop responding to situations in the present through lenses unconsciously distorted by our psychological histories and, especially, the quirks and biases bequeathed to us by our invariably somewhat complicated childhoods.\nA person who ‘grows’ is likely to be able to look more fairly at other people and situations – and to recognise the extent to which they might be aggravating conflict or heaping unwarranted suspicion or ruining their chances – because they bear within them presumptions shaped by hard-to-recall experiences of loneliness, fear, betrayal and humiliation. A person who has grown will more readily be able to check their first unhelpful responses to things and reach for a more complicated, objective set of explanations. It may not always have to be their companion’s fault. Perhaps a mistake was – in this instance – innocent. It might be their role to say a small sorry. Maybe they’ve misunderstood what was really being meant.\nTo grow is to acquire the courage for new sorts of questions:\n— What if I were repeatedly defending myself against closeness and hope?\n— What if I was using busy-ness to block encounters with my own mind?\n— What if I secretly manoeuvred to end a relationship prematurely because I felt safe with feelings of isolation and rejection?\n— What if I was running away from opportunities to show myself authentically to others?\nThese questions can, in personal life, be what we might in science describe as Copernican; questions that involve a fundamental rethinking of one’s place in the order of things.\nThe more one ‘grows’, the more one might have to give up a certain sort of confidence and certainty – not in the name of meekness or self-hatred, but for the sake of a newfound scepticism, a patient modesty and a humorous readiness to wryly acknowledge error and admit to fragility. \nA person who has grown might:\n— Operate with a vivid sense of how much they misunderstand\n— Appreciate their fear of intimacy and joy\n— More often say, ‘I don’t know‘ or ‘Let me perhaps think more about that.’ Even sometimes, on really special occasions, ‘I think you may have a point.’\n— Be more receptive to friendships built around a recoginition of vulnerability and anxiety.\nWhat spurs growth is – unfortunately – almost always pain. We grow because we were fired and then, already shattered, were finally able to look at what colleagues around us might have found difficult about us for many years. We grow because we lost a major love – and at last (as we weep in a corner of the airport lounge) see that we might have been far too guarded or demanding or frightened. We grow because, in an hour of need, we can’t bear to be alone any more and realise (as if for the first time) what friendship could be for.\nThe greatest sign of growth might be a readiness to calmly take on board the scale of one’s silliness; how many basic things one is still learning; what a child one still is. A person who has grown won’t see anything offensive at all, indeed will stoically accept the idea, that they have been, very often indeed, over some quite major things (if we can put this very politely) a bit of an idiot – and will be intensely committed to trying to be rather less of one in the precious time that remains.",

For a long time, it simply seems that one has miraculously fallen in with a partner entirely well attuned to all of one’s tastes and proclivities. One loves that particular show? Amazingly, so do they. This song is by one’s favourite band: they’ve adored it for years. Pasta with mushrooms; it’s exactly what they crave.&nbsp;\nThis can feel profoundly thrilling. For all the lipservice we tend to pay to appreciating differences, it is – secretly – the similarities we long for. \n\nEliseo Meifrén y Roig, A Square in Paris, 1887\n\nBut a more complicated and human truth is fated eventually to emerge. They told us they were delighted with an item of clothing we bought for them; one day we find they’ve gone out and swapped it for something else. They told us they hated a particular person we were suspicious of; they’ve had lunch with them yesterday. They assured us they had no ambitions in a particular area; their search history suggests otherwise.&nbsp;\nWe might – in irritation – be tempted to label our companion ‘a liar’ or ‘deceitful.’ But something more poignant is at play. What we have on our hands is that most benighted of psychological types: the people-pleaser, a harried soul morbidly fearful of expressing their true opinions lest these clash with those of others and prone to initiating a variety of secret agendas in the hope of continuing to be liked.\nPeople-pleasers are hard enough at the office and in ordinary friendships. They are especially tricky in love for their behaviour so carefully tickles the area of our most profound hope: that someone – at last – agrees with us. It isn’t that the people-pleaser is deep down entirely at odds with us; that would be too neat and in a sense simple enough to deal with. It’s just we can’t easily tell where natural alignment ends and manic subservient agreement begins; what should we make of this musical enthusiasm? Do they really think exactly as we do about money? The questions get ever larger and more consequential: is their sexuality really what they say? Do they actually want to get married? \nThe tragedy is that the people-pleaser is deep down just horribly afraid. Something in their past has proved to them that they can never be forgiven for speaking their minds. Their childhoods have been a lesson in the importance of shape shifting. Surrounding cruelty means they have had to grow into geniuses at detecting what the other person wants – and at serving it up to them with near-total fidelity. \nWe know what we need to do in theory: to give our companion a repeated taste of the acceptability of their true tastes in music, pasta, friendship and existence. The problem is that we tend to get so upset when we stumble on examples of incongruent behaviour that we do precisely the opposite. We lose our tempers at their subterfuges and thereby enforce their very worst fears: that honesty never pays, that they must just lie better next time.\nHumour may have to be the answer. As early as we can, we need to give them a toy chameleon as a gift – and send the animals as emojis with a question mark whenever they outline their wishes for the weekend or show deep enthusiasm for our career plans. We have to show that a clashes in views need not be a catastrophe. That when there is genuine love, of the kind there never was at their origins, differences can be survivable, that in a functioning relationship, an argument is invariably better than a lie.",

      "text": "A lot about our behaviour doesn’t make sense until we can take on board a basic idea about the way we humans are built: that our biology privileges survival over self-awareness. In other words, the most important priority for members of our species is to live and to keep going, not to pause, understand and take stock. \n\nHenri Matisse, The Invalid, 1899\n\nPlace any new human in a terrible circumstance – let’s say, in a home with a violent or alcoholic parent, or an abusive or depressed one – and it won’t, as one might imagine it could, be able to focus clearly on what has gone wrong or mourn its condition. It will simply – as we’ve ascertained it must – keep going.\nIn order to do this, it will call upon a range of innate survival techniques. It may start to think surprisingly well of its parents, declaring them justified in their beatings, selfishness and humiliation. It might assiduously blame itself rather than sparing any pity for its own deprivations. Let’s remember that a sense of self-compassion can be a very dangerous thing indeed when one is five years old and no one would listen even if one yelled. Or else it will ward off despair through activity: it will over-achieve at school. Or break windows. Or become obsessed with drugs or sport or politics; anything not to have to listen to the buzz inside. The benighted child can’t look back, it can’t glance down. It must simply stare ahead at the main goal: survival.\nThis priority can last for a very long time indeed. After all, a sense of external security isn’t remotely assured for most of us until we have settled in a career, built up some capital, bought a home, found a spouse, maybe had some children. By which time we might in our 40s or 50s.\nYet our excellence at survival doesn’t take away from the basic fact of our situation. We have been born into a mess. We have the ingredients of madness inside us. We have been unmoored by cruelty. We are (quietly, in the recesses of our soul) close to insanity at points, the ineluctable result of too much suffering encountered too soon.\nBut as the external world gets ever safer for us, the internal world has a chance to feel as troubled as it always has been. We may feel stranger inside at forty than at twenty – even though the causes of our disturbances lie in events far closer to the latter date than the former.\nEventually, the pent up fear and sadness are liable to find a way through. We’ll start to do something odd: write long letters to strangers or crash the car or sob in public. Or develop a certainty that the government is following us. The legacy of the unkindness of which we’ve been the recipients begins to emerge.\nWith any luck, we may soon enough wind up in a clinic – or the consulting room of an experienced therapist. And here have a chance to find out more about the sadness and loss that have been inside us since the start. \nWe may finally feel safe enough to let out a very long scream – and meet with the love and understanding that were our due from the start.",

We curse if we can no longer remember the name of an acquaintance, if a fact escapes us, if we realise we went all the way to the shops and clean forgot an item we’d set out to buy.\nBut whatever the frustrations of these slips, we should in reality be boundlessly grateful for any evidence of the faultiness of our memories. Far from lamenting that we let certain things go, we should long to have far worse memories than we have.\n\nEdgar Degas, Self-Portrait, c. 1852\n\nWere it not for our ability to forget, we would be forced to be in a turmoil of regret and grief pretty much every hour, for to never forget is to be permanently pressed up against the worst collisions between our wishes and the horrible course of reality. If we didn’t forget as well as we do, we would need to remember with shocking vividness some of the following:\n— The day our first partner left us.\n— The day our exam results came and with them the end of our dreams about a certain university.\n— The day we were fired.\n— The day we fell out with our best friend.\n— The day we said or did a ridiculous thing and everything changed.\n— The day the cardiac surgeon took us into their office and gave us the news.\n— The day the pain started in our leg.\n— The day we got divorced.\n— The day our father died.\n— The day we were disgraced— The day we lost the business.\nWe all have such a list – or will do soon enough. The miracle is that however atrocious it may be, however much we feel at the time that nothing can ever be the same again, that life will be utterly senseless given what has just happened, our minds are astonishingly skilled at not insisting on keeping our losses perpetually in view. With a miraculous beneficence, after a period of torture, they do eventually let go of many of the details of the devastating event that made us feel that we would never be able to survive.\nFor days and months, it continues to seem like yesterday that our friend died or that we were cast out of society. For a long time, every morning begins with the same shocking realisation of our stupidity and error. But then, so gradually as to be almost imperceptible, contrary to our despair, we begin to overlook our previous reality – when our friend was still alive, when we still had our good name, when we were still loved – and the horror begins to loosen its grip. We aren’t happy; we just lose sight of what happiness was once like.\nWe lose an active sense of contrast between then and now The terrible event becomes a settled part of our histories. We become to ourselves ‘the person who had to be fired’, or ‘the person whose dad had to die when they were only 22…’ or ‘the person whose marriage was going to fall apart after just four years.’ \nWe can look at our idiocy and ill fortune and retain a melancholy basic equanimity. We no longer think we need to die. We can on occasion even smile a little because we have forgotten so much about the life we have lost.\nIt’s no doubt frustrating to forget our passport or the dates of a civil war. But these failures sit on top of a seismic advantage. We are able to endure our sufferings not because we are wise, but because we have such wonderfully poor memories.",

We’ll have gone on courses, read books, hired psychiatrists and psychotherapists, taken medicines. And through this, we would have veered between despair and hope that we might eventually be able to achieve a victory over our monsters.\nBut the more time passes, the more we have to take on board a bleaker, unavoidable reality: this thing is here for the long term. In the one life we’ll ever have, this is us. We’ll never be rid of the bugs. We have a chronic condition, not an illness.\n\nPhoto by Ron Lach, 2021, Pexels\n\nHow can we survive this ostensibly extremely dispiriting realisation? A range of thoughts come to mind.\n&#8211; A certain mindset\nFirst and foremost, we need a certain mindset, one combining intense doses of pessimism with bleak humour and the most tender compassion. We never asked for this, we didn’t do anything especially wrong, it’s not a sign of a sinful nature. We can speculate at length about where it comes from: an emotional inheritance, a biological condition, the outcome of certain choices we’ve made… It will be a distinctive mixture of all these and, in the grander scheme, it may not really matter. The task is ultimately just to accept that this is the fight of our lives.\n&#8211; Celebrate Small Wins\nAgainst a bleak picture, we need to redraw our horizons and expectations. We’re never going to solve the whole problem, therefore we need to be able to particularly celebrate when things aren’t especially awful; when we have a good day or two. We know &#8211; by now &#8211; that the problems are always going to return, which is why we have no option but to draw maximal satisfaction when, every now and then, we go through a steady and coherent passage. We need to become the sort of people who can say, without irony or bitterness, Wednesday went well and that’s a serious accomplishment. Other people climb mountains for a challenge, or go racing around a motor track at 200mph; our extreme sport is the challenge of staying alive.\n&#8211; The Right People Around Us\nWe don’t want to be judgemental but a lot of people, perhaps most people, are really not going to be very helpful to us. They may have the sweetest dispositions and interesting lives, but in essence, they will never be able to understand us (to put it more accurately, their circumstances mean they will never feel a need to understand our minds and good for them, we would be the same if we were any luckier) and their experiences will always feel remote and alien as a result. We need to seek out people who either know the condition from the inside or &#8211; because of some fortuitous bend in their minds &#8211; feel somehow instinctively close to it anyway. We need people who can let us despair but also know how to encourage us to laugh; people who won’t accuse us of malingering, or making a meal out of nothing; who won’t look wide eyed and full of judgement as we detail what we have been up to and some of the wildest thoughts that course through us in the early hours. We need &#8211; more than most &#8211; a lot of love. And yet (of course) we’ll be unusually inept at finding it, as damaged people are.\n&#8211; Care\nWe need to remain at all times vigilant, knowing how susceptible we are. One of the enemies we have to deal with is our own sudden assumptions that we might, after all, be well again. So we need to be always on our guard as to the likelihood of a relapse. We should formulate plans but hold on to them very lightly. We should realise the link between busy-ness and mania and take extreme measures to live soberly. We should acknowledge, and fully honour, the differences between ourselves and other more robust people.",

Our pasts seem like they are full of things that are going to come back to ruin us. Perhaps someone will soon realise that something we said two decades ago offended them and they will come for revenge. Perhaps we spoke to a colleague in the wrong way last week and discipline and disgrace are on their way. Perhaps we were speeding and a camera caught us. Our kidney may be failing, our minds disintegrating. Or, more broadly still, civilisation may be on the edge of fracture.\nWe might &#8211; as we worry &#8211; be lying in bed. It might be Sunday evening. We might not be seeing anyone until tomorrow and may have been in the house by ourselves since yesterday. It doesn’t feel like we can be in touch with anyone, as they are mostly with their families. Or at parties.&nbsp;\nAt this point, we might ask a question of our mood that sounds deliberately and provocatively strange: Might I principally, at heart, be lonely rather than worried?\n\nHotel Window, Edward Hopper, 1955\n\nThe question rests on a particular thesis about the mind: we may prefer the discomforts of persecution to the quiet torments of isolation. We may get into the habit of using panic to keep us company. It may be appalling to think that catastrophes are about to happen to us, but at least these imply that people &#8211; perhaps many, many people &#8211; are thinking of us. We may not have friends but we have an adjacent thing: a plethora of enemies holding us tightly in mind. We may favour persecution over neglect; the wail of a siren to the eeriness of silence.&nbsp;\nWe may also unconsciously have found an answer to a problem posed by our companionless state. Why have we been left alone? Because we must have done something wrong, because we are fitting targets for neglect, because we are bad people.\nOur way of thinking may have a history. We may have lacked suitably warm and supportive company since the start of our lives &#8211; and may have become accustomed to appeasing our alienation with foreboding and trepidation. The deserted child evolves into the always-worried adult.&nbsp;\nTo attempt to reverse our way of thinking, we should learn to pay attention to what might be happening around the time our panicky moods set in. When did we last speak with someone kind? How long have we been by ourselves? How supportive are our bonds to those around us? We may &#8211; without noticing &#8211; have reached unsuspected levels of alienation.\nWe may at such times have to learn to trust our feelings a little less. These feelings might insist that doom is at hand, but we may need to remember that our real yearning could be for a proper friend. We may need to sit with ourselves, as we would with anyone we cared for, and try our best to be kind. We aren’t appalling people. We’re just not good at building and maintaining close connections &#8211; for reasons that go right back to the start.&nbsp;\nWe need to hold on to what will at first simply feel like an idea rather than a native truth. We have done nothing wrong and nothing awful is imminent. We are just &#8211; below the surface &#8211; distinctly lonely and craving solidarity. And probably, a long tight hug too.",

      "text": "Many of us dimly sense that, despite ourselves, unfortunately and mysteriously, we keep ending up in some very similar dark places: perhaps another relationship with someone who doesn’t seem to love us properly, or another breakdown of trust at work, or another panic about reputation or sex. Or else the repeated patterns involve a return to a background mood: yet again we feel highly anxious. Yet again we feel convinced that everyone hates us or that something terrible is about to happen.\n\nEdward le Bas, Anchovy Packers, c. 1950\n\nPsychotherapists have given all this a name. In so far as we keep steering ourselves back to some familiar negative circumstances or emotions, we may be in the grip of what is known as a ‘repetition compulsion.’ We aren’t here again by coincidence, we are – in an unconscious part of our minds – steering ourselves to a place of pain with hidden intent.\nThis is a hugely perplexing notion to have to take on board. It’s bad enough to keep winding up in particular trouble, it’s even worse to have to think that we’re being driven towards it by an ineluctable internal force. We naturally want to repeat pleasure; but why seek to repeat frustration, sabotage and alarm?\nPsychotherapists have a suggestion. We can never let go of any negative experience, they tell us, until it has been fully understood. An issue will remain active for us – even if it is decades old – so long as it has not been acknowledged and its emotional resonance identified and allowed to dissipate.\nThe experiences that we are driven to repeat are – these therapists go on to say – precisely those that we have not been able to square up to. We repeat what we have sidestepped and left unacknowledged. A part of our minds is committed to forcing us back to a zone of original difficulty not in order that we suffer aimlessly, but so that we may eventually find freedom through understanding. \nTherefore, in this account, we aren’t seeking simply to be unhappy. An emotional conscience is pushing us towards the location of our buried truths in the name of eventual release. Our sad and anxious rehearsals are like ghosts that keep manifesting themselves until a foundational injustice is uncovered and worked through.\nPsychotherapy points out that the patterns we are most likely to be repeating are ones that date back to childhood, because this is the period when we are both least able to understand what is going on in ourselves and most at the mercy of the adults around us.&nbsp;\nWe may – in our search for release from our repetitions – need to be very brave in remembering what might have gone on many years before. Matters were perhaps not as simple as we might have assumed. If we keep nowadays finding ourselves in a panic that someone will try to humiliate us or if we seek love from distracted and incapable people or spoil our professional chances, we may need to wonder: how might our negative patterns be following in the tracks of earlier pains? \nWhat our impulse to repeat is in essence inviting us to do is to pause and mourn. Just as we have to do when someone we love dies, we need to stop evading our suffering and give ourselves time to absorb it from a range of angles, at multiple points of day and night, and in relation to different moods.\nWe may have to mourn that our father’s sexuality was far too complicated, or that our mother couldn’t deal with our vulnerability. Or that a sibling was favoured. Or that we have made a mess of our adult love lives because we have grown up without an ability to trust or assert ourselves.&nbsp;\nThe reward for doing this painful work is that eventually our minds can be expected to relent. Once we have kept an appointment with our primal griefs, we can gradually hope to drift away from them and the patterns to which they have given rise. The part of us that isn’t able to rest until the truth has been exhumed will let us plough new, less frightened tracks once it is sufficiently convinced that we have – finally – mourned and understood.",

      "text": "We like to draw a firm line between the people we casually call ‘mad’ and the rest of us. The mad ones make no sense; they have gone into another world; they are – in a way that almost comforts us – no longer quite human.\nYet what the last hundred years of psychotherapy have taught us is that the so-called mad are in fact much closer to the apparently balanced majority than is typically countenanced – and that if we look with sufficient rigour at the unusual and counter-productive behaviour the mentally unwell exhibit, we almost always find a logic within it that can be decoded, listened to and in many cases dealt with. We might say: mad behaviour contains a complex, frightening and baroque flight from an unmanageable.\n\nWilliam Dyce, King Lear and the Fool in the Storm, 1851\n\nLet’s look at some typical presenting problems of people diagnosed with mental illness:\n1. Someone who says that they control the entire world and that they are at all times secretly influencing everything that happens in major events in public life.\nOne way to understand this kind of grandiosity is to see it as what is called ‘a manic defence’ – that is, a defence against its very opposite. Someone who has been made to feel utterly invisible, who has been controlled from a young age and stripped of a sense of agency and dignity, may in time flip psychotically into an opposite conviction – as a way to avoid a reckoning with a suffering that cannot be assimilated. This is a common feature of many mental illnesses: they stem from a failure to mourn something overwhelming, as here the idea that one has apparently never mattered to a soul.\n2. Someone develops a refusal to go outside because they think that at any moment, a stranger in a park or in a shop might turn around and try to kill them.\nLike many varieties of unwellness, this one reverses and then generalises its underlying truth. We start to think that ‘everyone’ is trying to kill us when, in fact, there may be one person we are boundlessly angry with, but can’t bear to acknowledge our rage against – perhaps because they are our own mother or father and maybe because they did something no parent is ever meant to do to a defenceless child. Unconscionable events are to be found behind almost every case of so-called ‘madness’.\n3. Someone who develops a phobia against all sharp objects and spends hours removing from their house anything that might pierce through skin: knives, but also forks, spatulas, tweezers and so on.\nA talented mental health professional will here immediately wonder: Who is this person furious with and why? They will try to move them from trying to prevent a murder to wondering who they might be very angry with. The more we can bear to think, the less we will need to colour the world with the legacies of our unconscious losses.\n4. Someone who shows up in hospital in an excited state with a 300,000 word book spelling out in enormous detail how everyone on earth is actually an alien sent by a foreign power inhabiting a gigantic spaceship making its way around another galaxy.\nSometimes ‘madness’, behind the outward drama and mystification, really contains a basic metaphor that speaks of a simple, poignant truth. Perhaps, in this case, everyone feels horrifically ‘like an alien’ – and it might be far easier to think that that this is what they actually are, with their brains connected up to an invisible foreign satellite, than to absorb a more awful humdrum reality: that other people are quite human but that they have nevertheless, tragically, ignored our own humanity for as long as we’ve been on the earth.\n5. A conviction that we might have touched a child sexually – and a horror of ever seeing a small child in case we suddenly do something untoward with them. An accompanying fear that the police is likely to knock at the door at any moment and accuse us of a crime.\nOnce again, this phobia contains an inversion of the likely truth. The sufferer takes on board extreme degrees of guilt and responsibility because – though it isn’t easy to make a detour around every park or playground and to panic at the sound of every police siren – it is still easier to do this than to square up to the horror that may have befallen us at a helpless age: we prefer to inhabit the role of the perpetrator than to face up to a catastrophic instance of our violation. \nAs for the thoughts of the police, these constitute a paranoid defence against something yet worse: being totally alone. After all, the upside of the police is that they are always thinking about us; they are about to show up to see us at any moment, even in the middle of the night, when it’s otherwise deadly quiet and eerie. Someone is thinking about who we are and the details of what we have done at 3am. Terror can be the closest thing we know to a feeling of being held in mind.\n6. A constant need to clean ourselves of the germs and pollutants that lie all around. We’re in the bath at least five times a day. We disinfect anything we touch. \nOnce more, we’re dealing with a pain that has jumped from reality to metaphor. Someone somewhere along the way has made us feel unclean and ‘bad’ and we are manically trying to rid ourselves of a sense of unwantedness that we are unable to master in any more cognitive way. We’re craving acceptance – but have the strength to think only of ever more harmful and devastating germs that might be pursuing us.\nAlmost every incident of ‘madness’ involves truths that the sufferer doesn’t have the resources to handle, normally because they were never shown a bare minimum of patience and concern in their early days – and now can’t reflect steadily on their pains and losses. Almost every case of madness contains within it instances of cruelty that could not be borne in ordinary, everyday ways, that could not be thought about and shared (because no one was around, because the adults were out of control) and that a sufferer therefore had to erect a superstructure of folly in order to cope with. There have had to be aliens and satellites and prescribed rituals and obsessions because one can’t find any other way to come to terms with the simpler but more devastating underlying truths: ‘no one loved me’, ‘someone who should have cared didn’t’ or ‘I could die and no one would notice.’\nWe start to take on board a lacerating but in the end almost hopeful idea: that it is nothing more nor less than a lack of love that – ultimately – drives us mad. And its opposite could save us.",

Every time we finally take pride in ourselves and develop a confidence about the future, something adverse seems to happen within a relatively short order. It might be something that we find ourselves actively doing that collapses our spirits, or we start to worry acutely about a matter that suddenly enters our minds or an incident occurs from out of the blue that unsettles us. \n\nPhoto by Steven HWG on Unsplash\n\nMaybe we read something online that seems mean-minded and worrying. Or we catch sight of ourselves in the mirror and feel repulsed. Or we suddenly think of something we said or did seven and a half years ago that may have been misinterpreted and misconstrued – and start to panic. Or by some odd impulse that we don’t really understand and so can’t resist, we do something foolish and contrary to our normal values which brings on guilt and shame. And as a result, we are ‘brought back down to earth’ fairly sharply. We end up – only hours or days after the good mood began – in a familiar place of fear, anxiety and disappointment. \nIt can be as if – without quite realising it – we are operating under some sort of secret law: thou shalt never be exuberant. Thou shalt never live life too much to the full. Thou shalt never be too happy. Thou shalt not believe in yourself. Thou shalt worry a lot.\nWhere might such a perverse and sad edict have come from? It may be the result of growing up in an environment where our flourishing was somehow deemed unwelcome and provocative. Had we ever been too conspicuously happy, we might have upset a parent who was battling a sense of despair or resignation and was furious at the deprivations they once had to endure. And who could not count countenance that a child of theirs might be any more content than they were.&nbsp;\nWe may have grown up to associate a low fearful mood with safety. Sadness means you don’t get attacked, it doesn’t provoke envy. It keeps you out of trouble.\nWhenever happiness does seem on the cards, a part of us will hence be very keen to return us to a lower altitude as soon as possible. To achieve our ends, there may be some favourite websites we like to go to that confirm that we are unattractive, or strange or in danger. We may provoke arguments, insults or offence. We’ve got a repertoire of secret skills to wipe the smile off our faces.\nWere any of this to ring bells, we should ask ourselves: what incentives against happiness and self-satisfaction might there have been in our early lives? Who might we have upset with our joy? Was there a conflict between our flourishing and someone else’s sense of well-being?\nThen we need to reassure the frightened child in us that the person who demanded our sadness as a price for their protection is no longer in authority over us. We don’t have to apologise for being attractive or intelligent or gifted or within reach of stability, sanity, potency and good spirits. We are – whatever we once believed – allowed to live without continuous sadness and fear.",

Our self perception strikes us as ‘natural.’ It has been with us for as long as we can remember. It seems ingrained. It is who and what we are – not something created by partial, circumstantial forces. And therefore, very consequentially, we take it as both true and beyond enquiry.\n\nPhoto by&nbsp;Alina Scheck&nbsp;on&nbsp;Unsplash\n\nIt may be neither – which is why we have good cause to lean in on one of the most fundamental laws of psychological functioning, which states that the way we feel about ourselves is an internalisation of how others felt about us during our formative years. Our self-esteem is a mirror of the esteem in which we were held by those around us. What we expect of ourselves is a reflection of what others expected from us in childhood. What we think the future will bring is shaped by what the past brought us.\nIt sounds a simple principle but it is an enormously hard one to keep in mind – let alone thread back through our own experience. We may understand the idea intellectually; it can be the work of much of our lives to feel its truth – and untie its legacy – in our own particular case.\nThe past has a habit of leaving few active traces. We register emotions without being able to follow them back to any source. But we can and should work against the forces of forgetting. We should re-historicise our self esteem. We should trace our thoughts about our likely futures back to our pasts. We should learn to sense the verdicts of other people where we have until now registered only a verdict from nature or ‘reality’.\nTo see how this principle of self-esteem works, we can look at its positive manifestations first. \nThe thought: I am a valuable, lovely person.Indicates that: Others once found me lovely. \nOr:\nThe thought: Things are going to be OK for me.Indicates that: Nice things once happened around me.\nOr:\nThe thought: I can contribute.Indicates that: Others once thought I could contribute. \nBut it’s an exploration of the negative side of the principle that yields the greatest dividends.\nThe thought: I’m not good enough.Indicates that: Other people once didn’t find me good enough.\nOr:\nThe thought: I’m terrified I’ve done something wrong.Indicates that: Other people once constantly accused me of doing something wrong (in other words, did something wrong to me).\nOr:\nThe thought: I can’t do anything.Indicates that: Other people once thought I was hopeless.\nOr:\nThe thought: I’m an idiot.Indicates that: Other people once thought I was stupid.&nbsp;\nOr:\nThe thought: I’m clumsy.Indicates that: Other people once got impatient with my natural childhood inabilities and locked me into a description that deprived me of confidence.\nOr:\nThe thought: I feel invisible.Indicates that: I once wasn’t seen. \nAll this is particularly difficult because our feelings about who we are and what might happen to us aren’t just passive elements but are in the habit of actively determining our futures. The person who feels a failure will end up failing; the person who feels a bore will end up boring. And so on. We haven’t just suffered once; we may get stuck in a loop of sadness.\nThe priority is therefore to stop taking our self-esteem as a given and to start to look at is the outgrowth of a period of personal experience that we have not been able to keep in mind – and that can be questioned. Once we have properly absorbed this principle of psychology, it becomes open to us to reassess our value and prospects by a more just means. We no longer need to judge ourselves through the eyes of people who were too unwell and in pain to see us properly.",

People who combine an exquisite talent for upset with an even greater talent for sentimental apology.\n— People who will flirt with others, then call it ‘only a bit of fun’ and label you a prude for minding.\n— People who will mess up your house and call you ‘anal’; people who will prioritise time with their friends over time with you and then call you ‘controlling.’\n— People who tell you you are ‘imagining things’ a lot.\n— People who harbour a background grudge against your gender.\n— People who are furious with a parent and don’t realise they are.\n— People who can’t forgive anyone who thinks better of them than they think of themselves.\n— People who claim desperately to want a relationship – but are inwardly so committed to distrust, isolation and self-hatred that they are in no position to really have one – yet don’t know this of themselves. \n— People who principally associate love with the pleasant feelings they register when you are nice to them.\n— People who don’t take your love as a substantial gift you chose to bestow every day and could take elsewhere. \n— People who don’t realise your time is very, very precious.\n— People who are far too in pain to know how to want the best for you.\n— People who refuse to do the necessary work.\nLet’s remember; the people in the list above comprise some of the most charming, beautiful, vivacious, seductive characters on the planet.

A great many relationships get off the ground on the basis of our skills at self-presentation; couples head home from the restaurant hand in hand, and a union has a chance to grow. But this artful emphasis on appearing normal while actually being – below the surface – something infinitely more complicated is a catastrophe waiting to unfurl. For it is never long before our actual complexity starts to rear its head, and has all the more impact on our partner because they were given no preparation for it.\nTime is bound to show that we’re wrestling with severe bouts of depression which we rely on pills to appease; that we are hugely ambivalent about love and feel nauseous in the face of kindness and tenderness; or still rely on the presence of an ex to ward off our fears of intimacy with our new partner. None of it can be wished away.\nIt’s all maddeningly complicated but arguably the place for these sorts of complexities is towards the start, not when two people have spent five months pretending to be upbeat caricatures of themselves, only for the weirdness to begin to seep out in unheralded ways.\nWe should tolerate that far fewer dates would work out on the basis that we had been honest about ourselves – but at least those that did proceed would be built on solid foundations.\nIn a less simplistically minded dating scene, two people would, at a certain point in an early meal, simply say: ‘Now tell me the true, really bad bits,’ and make time for genuine disclosure and the tolerance and broad-mindedness of the psychotherapy room.\nTo know is to be given agency. We won’t then need to sit in the car home with two passengers, a ‘normal’ person we’d love to be with, and their complicated ‘shadow’ who is biding their time before initiating havoc.\nIt’s not possible for a person to have reached maturity without harbouring some difficult elements – and the place where these belong is squarely by the last course of an early date, not several months or years down the line. It’s only too easy to begin a relationship with some well-meaning lies. The only ethical, mature love is the one in which we have had the courage to be properly known – and have been kind enough to offer a comprehensive guide to ourselves to any serious prospective partner.",

      "text": "Seldom do we need the insights of psychotherapy as urgently as when it comes to cases of male heterosexual impotence. A man can be physiologically entirely capable of having sex but then finds himself in bed with a woman he longs for and cannot enter, to his boundless embarrassment and shame. What might be going on?\n\nDetail from Still Life by Dirck de Horn, 18th Century\n\nWe have to imagine what has to go right towards the start of a life in order to minimise the chances of this kind of psychological impotence later down the line. One of the great guarantors of adult male potency is the love of a certain kind of woman in childhood. So that a man can later on feel at home with his physical desire, it helps immensely if his central female caregiver is able to do two things: firstly, if she signals that the little man in her life is adored by her but in a way that encompasses and rewards his more robust and rumbustious sides. The little man might be very much allowed to play with a plastic sword, he can occasionally make a big noise, it’s not a terrible problem if he sometimes brings in some mud from the garden. He doesn’t just have to be a sweet, neat, tender innocent angel; he can be a more dynamic, powerful creature too. At the same time, it may be of great help if this maternal figure is resolved in her relationships with men: if she isn’t unduly scared of them, if she isn’t furious with them, if she hasn’t undergone a trauma at the hands of one of them, if she can – once the kids are asleep – have a very satisfying time in bed with one of their kind.\nFathers also have a key role to play in their son’s later potency. If they can give a boy a feeling that they can tolerate rivalry, that there is room enough in town for both of them, if they can suggest that the boy’s growing strength and vigour are sources of pride rather than threat.\nNeedless to say, none of this is guaranteed. There are otherwise extremely devoted maternal figures who somehow manage to suggest to their sons that it might be better if they didn’t remind them of the sort of men who have scared or damaged them; or who bring to bear on their ‘little man’ some of the anger that belongs to, and that they deep down wish to direct towards, ‘big men’ elsewhere. Or who turn their boys into substitute ‘boyfriends’ as a defence against their fear of a more three dimensional adult relationship. Just as there are dads who are too internally fragile to tolerate that anyone but they should have potency in the household.\nThe result, twenty years later, can be a man who panics at the sublime moment when a woman turns to him and says: ‘Come on, let’s go upstairs; I’ve been wanting you since the evening started’. It might sound delightful; to a certain sort of man, it can mean the onset of devastating panic. They are being invited to do the very thing that – according to the logic of their formative years – would have variously hurt, offended, angered or threatened the people they had to rely on. Their impotence, though entirely inconvenient today, is in their deep minds a necessary mechanism to steer them away from danger and upset.\nWhat could be done to alleviate the situation? Most importantly, a conversation, so that the partner doesn’t feel that they are to blame and that their own insecurities don’t start to fill the vacuum of explanation.&nbsp;\nIt might also help if the man were made into less of a focus of attention in bed. It might do wonders if the woman shared a fantasy about another person, male or female, (perhaps a colleague at work or someone she spotted on the train home), so that – witnessing the woman’s authentic excitement – the man might slowly find his way back to his own.\nIt’s possible to argue at length about whether psychotherapeutic theory is ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’ We should probably reserve judgement until, physically in perfect health, we find ourselves unable to be get an erection with someone we intensely desire. It seems that – very sadly – we may just be a lot more complicated than we should be.",

      "text": "We spend a lot of time in relationships feeling annoyed and upset by the other’s evidently maddening behaviour. Why can’t they be more emotionally present? Or less needy? Or more reliable? Or not so interested in what their friends think?\nThe questions can go on for a very long time – and are not without their private satisfactions. We may be forlorn, yet at least we know where the problems lie.\n\nChristian Krohg, Sleeping Fisherman, 1882\n\nHowever, if ever we get bored of the pleasures of this kind of frustration, we might take on a challenge that can initially feel extremely strange and even offensive: we might imagine that, to a critical extent, we share in the problems which we have until now concentrated on forensically locating in the partner.\nWe might set ourselves the following exercise: to write down the many things or thing that we feel the partner is doing wrong and that we know very well indeed by this point. For example, that they are:\n— A social climber\n— Always dissatisfied with their career\n— Too nervous around authority\n— Unable to open their hearts properly\n— Unwilling to discuss emotions.\nThen, when our list is complete, with our courage in our hands, we should write down a title at the top of the list: ‘My faults’. In other words, we should imagine that all those appalling things the partner does are actually also behaviours in which we are in key ways implicated.\nWe can lean on a general law of psychology: it’s a customary human habit to relocate in others what one can’t bear to see in oneself. The things that most upset us in our friends, acquaintances and lovers are typically the things that are simultaneously most unresolved in our minds. They would not touch us so much if we didn’t at a deep level recognise them as intolerable elements of our makeup. We may not so much be stumbling on flaws in someone else as needing to find them in another so that we aren’t so much at risk of encountering them in us.\nWe know this phenomenon well enough in the case of the school bully. We know that this unfortunate person tauntingly calls the other child ‘weak,’ ‘a mummy’s boy’ or ‘a scaredy-cat’ because they have an intense fear of such fragilities in themselves.&nbsp;\nWe may not directly be bullying our partners – but the psychological mechanism at play might be soberingly similar. We too may be calling our beloveds ‘cold’ or ‘snobs’, ‘chaotic’ or ‘rigid’ because these terms point to some very sore spots in our own histories from which we are in manic flight.\nTo bring a new atmosphere of creativity and generosity into the relationship, we should be prepared to assume a bold new dictum when we next encounter a conflict: that the problem is probably also in us. In other words, I am probably also a little afraid of intimacy or somewhat nervous around the judgements of others or overly impressed by some of my friends. It’s been an interesting move to burden the partner exclusively with this until now; it may be a lot more interesting and fruitful henceforth to say: ‘it could be both of us.’&nbsp;\nThis has the added advantage of endowing us with agency. Rather than presuming that there is nothing we can do to help our relationships until the partner decides to change, we can lead the way by smoothing out some of our share of the neurotic structure – which may encourage in the other the very evolutions we have been seeking in them in vain for so long.\nWe may not just have picked on a partner with a set of faults that we happen to find annoying. We may have carefully opted to accuse a partner of burdensome pieces of our own stories to lighten our minds. It may be time for a new mantra: it’s probably in us both.",
